      <p>
        This specification extends {{HTMLMediaElement}} [[HTML]] providing APIs to control playback
        of encrypted content.
      </p>
      <p>
        The API supports use cases ranging from simple clear key decryption to high value video
        (given an appropriate user agent implementation). License/key exchange is controlled by the
        application, facilitating the development of robust playback applications supporting a
        range of content decryption and protection technologies.
      </p>
      <p>
        This specification does not define a content protection or Digital Rights Management
        system. Rather, it defines a common API that may be used to discover, select and interact
        with such systems as well as with simpler content encryption systems. Implementation of
        Digital Rights Management is not required for compliance with this specification: only the
        [=Clear Key=] system is required to be implemented as a common baseline.
      </p>
      <p>
        The common API supports a simple set of content encryption capabilities, leaving
        application functions such as authentication and authorization to page authors. This is
        achieved by requiring content protection system-specific messaging to be mediated by the
        page rather than assuming out-of-band communication between the encryption system and a
        license or other server.

        Introduction
      </h2>
      <p>
        This specification enables script to select content protection mechanisms, control
        license/key exchange, and execute custom license management algorithms. It supports a wide
        range of use cases without requiring client-side modifications in each user agent for each
        use case. This enables content providers to develop a single application solution for all
        devices.
      </p>
      <p>
        Supported content is encrypted per container-specific "common encryption" specifications,
        enabling use across key systems. Supported content has an unencrypted container, enabling
        metadata to be provided to the application and maintaining compatibility with other
        {{HTMLMediaElement}} features.
      </p>
      <p>
        Implementers should pay attention to the mitigations for the security and privacy threats
        and concerns described in this specification. In particular, the specification requirements
        for security and privacy cannot be met without knowledge of the security and privacy
        properties of the [=Key System=] and its implementation(s). <a href=
        "#implementation-requirements"></a> contains security and privacy provisions related to the
        integration and use of underlying [=Key System=] implementations. <a href="#security"></a>
        focuses on external threats, such as input data or network attacks. <a href="#privacy"></a>
        focuses on the handling of user-specific information and providing users with adequate
        control over their own privacy.
      </p>
      <p class="note">
        While this specification is independent of the source of the media data, authors should be
        aware that many implementations only support decrypting media data provided via Media
        Source Extensions [[MEDIA-SOURCE]].
      </p>

        A generic stack implemented using the API is shown below. This diagram shows an example
        flow; other combinations of API calls and events are possible.

          <p>
            A Key System is a generic term for a decryption mechanism and/or content protection
            provider. Key System strings provide unique identification of a Key System. They are
            used by the user agent to select a [=CDM=] and identify the source of a key-related
            event. User agents MUST support the [=Common Key Systems=]. User agents MAY also
            provide additional [=CDMs=] with corresponding Key System strings.
          </p>
          <p>
            A Key System string is always a reverse domain name. Key System strings are compared
            using case-sensitive matching. It is RECOMMENDED that [=CDMs=] use simple lower-case
            ASCII key system strings.

            For example, "com.example.somesystem".
          </p>
          <p class="note">
            Within a given system ("somesystem" in the example), subsystems may be defined as
            determined by the key system provider. For example, "com.example.somesystem.1" and
            "com.example.somesystem.1_5". Key System providers should keep in mind that these will
            be used for comparison and discovery, so they should be easy to compare and the
            structure should remain reasonably simple.

            A Key Session, or simply Session, provides a context for message exchange with the
            [=CDM=] as a result of which key(s) are made available to the [=CDM=]. Sessions are
            embodied as {{MediaKeySession}} objects. Each Key session is associated with a single
            instance of [=Initialization Data=] provided in the
            {{MediaKeySession/generateRequest()}} call.
          </p>
          <p>
            Each Key Session is associated with a single {{MediaKeys}} object, and only media
            element(s) associated with that {{MediaKeys}} object may access key(s) associated with
            the session. Other {{MediaKeys}} objects, [=CDM=] instances, and media elements MUST
            NOT access the key session or use its key(s). Key sessions and the keys they contain
            are no longer [=usable for decryption=] once the session has been closed, including
            when the {{MediaKeySession}} object is destroyed.
          </p>
          <p>
            All license(s) and key(s) associated with a Key Session which have not been explicitly
            stored MUST be destroyed when the Key Session is closed.

          <p>
            A new Session ID is generated each time the user agent and [=CDM=] successfully create

          <p>
            Each Session ID SHALL be unique within the browsing context in which it was created.

            <code>true</code>, Session IDs MUST be unique within the [=origin=] over time,
            including across browsing sessions.

            Unless otherwise stated, key refers to a decryption key that can be used to decrypt
            blocks within [=HTMLMediaElement/media data=]. Each such key is uniquely identified by
            a [=key ID=]. A key is associated with the [=key session|session=] used to provide it
            to the [=CDM=]. (The same key may be present in multiple sessions.) Such keys MUST only
            be provided to the [=CDM=] via an {{MediaKeySession/update()}} call. (They may later be
            loaded by {{MediaKeySession/load()}} as part of the stored session data.)

          <p class="note">
            Authors SHOULD encrypt each set of stream(s) that requires enforcement of a
            meaningfully different policy with a distinct key (and key ID). For example, if
            policies may differ between two video resolutions, stream(s) containing one resolution
            should not be encrypted with the key used to encrypt stream(s) containing the other
            resolution. When encrypted, audio streams SHOULD NOT use the same key as any video
            stream. This is the only way to ensure enforcement and compatibility across clients.

          <p class="note">
            For example, a key is not usable for decryption if its license has expired. Even if its
            license has not expired, a key is not usable for decryption if other conditions (e.g.,
            output protection) for its use are not currently satisfied.

            A [=key=] is associated with a key ID that is a sequence of octets and which uniquely
            identifies the key. The container specifies the ID of the key that can decrypt a block
            or set of blocks within the [=HTMLMediaElement/media data=]. [=Initialization Data=]
            MAY contain key ID(s) to identify the keys that are needed to decrypt the media data.
            However, there is no requirement that Initialization Data contain any or all key IDs
            used in the [=HTMLMediaElement/media data=] or <a data-cite="html#media-resource">media
            resource</a>. [=Licenses=] provided to the [=CDM=] associate each key with a key ID so

            data.

            A key is considered to be known to a session if the [=CDM=]'s implementation of the
            session contains any information - specifically the [=key ID=] - about it, regardless
            of whether the actual [=key=] is usable or its value is known. Known keys are exposed
            via the {{MediaKeySession/keyStatuses}} attribute.

            Keys are considered known even after they become unusable, such as due to
            [=expiration=] or if they are removed but a [=record of license destruction=] is
            available. Keys only become unknown when they are explicitly removed from a session and

            [=Key Systems=] usually require a block of initialization data containing information
            about the stream to be decrypted before they can construct a license request message.
            This block could be a simple key or content ID or a more complex structure containing
            such information. It SHOULD always allow unique identification of the [=key(s)=] needed
            to decrypt the content. This initialization information MAY be obtained in some

          <p>
            The format of the initialization data depends upon the type of container, and
            containers MAY support more than one format of initialization data. The <dfn class=

            lower-case ASCII strings.

          <p>
            When the user agent encounters Initialization Data in the [=HTMLMediaElement/media

            MUST NOT store the Initialization Data or use its <em>content</em> at the time it is
            encountered. The application provides [=Initialization Data=] to the [=CDM=] via
            {{MediaKeySession/generateRequest()}}. The user agent MUST NOT provide [=Initialization
            Data=] to the [=CDM=] by other means.

            Initialization Data MUST be a fixed value for a given set of stream(s) or

          <p>
            Initialization Data SHOULD NOT contain Key System-specific data or values.

              Unrecognized dictionary members in <var>candidate configuration</var> are ignored per
              [[WEBIDL]] and will never reach this algorithm. Thus, they cannot be considered as

                For certain configurations, it may be required to obtain user consent or inform the
                user. User Agents have some flexibility to determine whether consent is required
                for a specific configuration and whether such consent may also apply to other
                configurations. For example, consent to one configuration may also imply consent
                for less powerful, more restricted configurations. Equally, a denial of consent for
                one configuration may imply denial of consent for more powerful, less restricted
                configurations.
              </p>
              <p>
                Supported configurations, including supported audio and video codecs, may depend on
                availability of optional capabilities such as [=Distinctive Identifier(s)=] and
                persistent state. The following algorithm iteratively tries to find a configuration
                that is both supported and has user consent (or does not need consent).
              </p>
              <p>
                User Agents should reuse earlier consent responses, when appropriate, at least for
                the duration of the {{Navigator/requestMediaKeySystemAccess()}} algorithm in order
                to avoid repeated requests to the user for similar configurations.

                The variable <var>restrictions</var> in the steps below represents the
                configurations for which consent has been denied during the execution of this
                algorithm or based on persisted consent information for the origin. It is used to
                determine whether user consent for a candidate configuration or accumulated
                configuration has been denied. Consent is denied for a accumulated configuration if
                every derived configuration has already been denied. Internal representation of
                <var>restrictions</var> is implementation-specific.

        The {{MediaKeys}} object represents a set of keys that an associated {{HTMLMediaElement}}

        represents a [=CDM=] instance.

        A {{MediaKeys}} object may be destroyed by the user agent when it is no longer accessible

        For methods that return a promise, all errors are reported asynchronously by rejecting the
        returned Promise. This includes [[WEBIDL]] type mapping errors.

        The steps of an algorithm are always aborted when rejecting a promise.

      <p>
        The User Agent SHALL execute the [=Monitor for CDM State Changes=] algorithm continuously

      <p>
        A {{MediaKeySession}} object SHALL NOT be destroyed and SHALL continue to receive events if
        it is not [=media key session/closed=] and the {{MediaKeys}} object that created it remains
        accessible. Otherwise, a {{MediaKeySession}} object that is no longer accessible SHALL NOT
        receive further events and MAY be destroyed.

          <p class="note">
            This algorithm only applies to [=CDM=] state changes that are not covered by other

          Session Storage and Persistence
        </h3>
        <p>
          This section provides an overview of session storage and persistence that complements the
          algorithms.
        </p>
        <p>
          The following requirements apply in addition to those in [=Storage and Persistence=].
        </p>
        <p>
          If the result of running the [=Is persistent session type?=] algorithm on this object's
          <var>session type</var> is <code>false</code>, the user agent and [=CDM=] MUST NOT
          persist a record of or data related to the session at any point. This includes
          license(s), key(s), [=record(s) of license destruction=], and the [=Session ID=].
        </p>
        <p>
          The remainder of this section applies to session types for which the [=Is persistent
          session type?=] algorithm returns <code>true</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The [=CDM=] SHOULD NOT store session data, including the Session ID, until
          {{MediaKeySession/update()}} is called the first time. Specifically, the [=CDM=] SHOULD
          NOT store session data during the {{MediaKeySession/generateRequest()}} algorithm. This
          ensures that the application is aware of the session and knows it needs to eventually
          remove it.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>All</em> data associated with a session MUST be cleared when the session is cleared,
          such as in {{MediaKeySession/update()}} when processing a [=record of license
          destruction=] acknowledgement. See <a href="#persistent-state-requirements">Persistent
          Data</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The [=CDM=] MUST ensure that data for a given session is only present in one
          {{MediaKeySession}} object that is not [=media key session/closed=] in any [=Document=].
          In other words, {{MediaKeySession/load()}} MUST fail when there is already a
          {{MediaKeySession}} representing the session specified by the <var>sessionId</var>
          parameter, either because the object that created it via
          {{MediaKeySession/generateRequest()}} is still active or it has been loaded into another
          object via {{MediaKeySession/load()}}. A session MAY only be loaded again if all objects
          that have ever represented it are [=media key session/closed=].
        </p>
        <p>
          An application that creates a session using a type for which the [=Is persistent session
          type?=] algorithm returns <code>true</code> SHOULD later remove the stored data by first
          initiating the removal process using {{MediaKeySession/remove()}} and then ensuring that
          the removal process, which may involve message exchange(s), successfully completes. The
          [=CDM=] MAY also remove sessions as appropriate, but applications SHOULD NOT rely on
          this.
        </p>
        <p>
          See <a href="#security"></a> and <a href="#privacy"></a> for additional considerations
          when supporting persistent storage.

          Media Element Restrictions
        </h3>
        <p>
          Media data processed by a [=CDM=] MAY be unavailable through web platform APIs in the
          usual way (for example using the {{CanvasRenderingContext2D}}
          {{CanvasDrawImage/drawImage()}} method and the {{AudioContext}}
          {{MediaElementAudioSourceNode}}). This specification does not define conditions for such
          non-availability of media data, however, if media data is not available to through such
          APIs then they MAY behave as if no media data was present at all.
        </p>
        <p>
          Where media rendering is not performed by the UA, for example in the case of a
          hardware-based media pipeline, the full set of HTML rendering capabilities, for example
          CSS Transforms, MAY be unavailable. One likely restriction is that video media MAY be
          constrained to appear only in rectangular regions with sides parallel to the edges of the
          window and with normal orientation.

        <p>
          User agent implementers MUST ensure that [=CDMs=] do not access any information, storage
          or system capabilities that are not reasonably required for playback of protected media
          using the features of this specification. Specifically, the [=CDM=] SHALL NOT:

              Access network resources, either local or remote, except via the user agent as
              explicitly permitted by this specification.

          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Access storage (e.g., disk or memory), except where reasonably required for playback
              of protected media using the features of this specification.

          User Agent implementers may use various techniques to meet the above requirements. For
          example, a User Agent implementer also implementing their own [=CDM=] may include the
          above as design requirements for that component. A User Agent implementer making use of a
          third party [=CDM=] may ensure that it executes in a constrained environment (e.g.,
          "sandbox") without access to the prohibited information and components.

            In-band support content, such as captions, described audio, and transcripts, SHOULD NOT
            be encrypted.

          <p class="note">
            Decryption of such tracks - especially such that they can be provided back the user
            agent - is not generally supported by implementations. Thus, encrypting such tracks
            would prevent them from being widely available for use with accessibility features in
            user agent implementations.
          </p>
          <p>
            To ensure accessibility information is available in usable form, for implementations
            that choose to support encrypted in-band support content: a) the [=CDM=] MUST provide
            the decrypted data to the user agent and b) the user agent MUST process it in the same
            way as equivalent unencrypted support content. For example, to be exposed as
            <a data-cite="html#timed-text-tracks">timed text tracks</a> [[HTML]].

          User Agents are responsible for providing users with a secure way to browse the web. This
          responsibility applies to any functionality used by User Agents, including
          functionalities from third parties. User agent implementers MUST obtain sufficient
          information from [=Key System=] implementers to enable them to properly assess the
          security implications of integrating with the [=Key System=]. User agent implementers
          MUST ensure [=CDM=] implementations provide and/or support sufficient controls for the
          user agent to provide security for the user. User agent implementers MUST ensure [=CDM=]
          implementations can and will be quickly and proactively updated in the event of security
          vulnerabilities.
        </p>
        <p>
          Exploiting a [=CDM=] implementation that is not fully sandboxed and/or uses platform
          features may allow an attacker to access OS or platform features, elevate privilege
          (e.g., to run as system or root), and/or access drivers, kernel, firmware, hardware, etc.
          Such features, software, and hardware may not be written to be robust against hostile
          software or web-based attacks and may not be updated with security fixes, especially
          compared to the user agent. Lack of, infrequent, or slow updates for fixes to security
          vulnerabilities in [=CDM=] implementations increases the risk. Such [=CDM=]
          implementations and UAs that expose them MUST be especially careful in all areas of
          security, including parsing of <a href="#input-data-security">all data</a>.
        </p>
        <p class="note">
          User agents should be especially diligent when using a [=CDM=] or underlying mechanism
          that is part of or provided by the client OS, platform and/or hardware.
        </p>
        <p>
          If a user agent chooses to support a [=Key System=] implementation that cannot be
          sufficiently sandboxed or otherwise secured, the user agent SHOULD <a href=

          Different authors sharing one host name, for example users hosting content on

        <p>
          Using the APIs defined in this specification on shared hosts compromises origin-based
          security and privacy mitigations implemented by user agents. For example, per-origin
          [=Distinctive Identifiers=] are shared by all authors on one host name, and peristed data
          may be accessed and manipulated by any author on the host. The latter is especially
          important if, for example, modification or deletion of such data could erase a user's
          right to specific content.
        </p>
        <p class="note">
          Even if a path-restriction feature was made available by user agents, the usual DOM

            Concerns
          </h4>
          <p>
            A third-party host (or any entity, such as an advertiser, capable of getting content
            distributed to multiple sites) could use a [=Distinctive Identifier=] or persistent
            data, including licenses, keys, key IDs, or [=records of license destruction=], stored
            by or on behalf of the [=CDM=] to track a user across multiple sessions (including
            across [=origins=] and [=browsing profiles=]), building a profile of the user's
            activities or interests. Such tracking would undermine the privacy protections provided
            by the rest of the web platform and could, for example, enable highly-targeted
            advertising not otherwise possible. In conjunction with a site that is aware of the
            user's real identity (for example, a content provider or e-commerce site that requires
            authenticated credentials), this could allow oppressive groups to target individuals
            with greater accuracy than in a world with purely anonymous web usage.
          </p>
          <p>
            User- or client-specific information that could be obtained via implementations of the
            APIs in this specification includes:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                [=Distinctive Identifier(s)=]
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                [=Distinctive Permanent Identifier(s)=]
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Origins visited (via stored or in-memory data, permissions, etc.)
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Content viewed (via stored or in-memory licenses, keys, key IDs, [=records of
                license destruction=], etc.)
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            This specification presents a specific concern because such information is commonly
            stored outside the user agent (and associated [=browsing profile=] storage), often in
            the [=CDM=].
          </p>
          <p>
            Since the content of licenses and [=records of license destruction=] are [=Key
            System=]-specific and since key IDs may contain any value, these data items could be
            abused to store user-identifying information.
          </p>
          <p>
            [=Key Systems=] may access or create persistent or semi-persistent identifier(s) for a
            device or user of a device. In some cases these identifiers may be bound to a specific
            device in a secure manner. If these identifiers are present in [=Key System=] messages,
            then devices and/or users may be tracked. If the mitigations below are not applied,
            this could include both tracking of users / devices over time and associating multiple
            users of a given device.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is important to note that such identifiers, especially those that are non-clearable,
            non-[=origin=]-specific, or [=permanent identifier|permanent=], exceed the tracking
            impact of existing techniques such as cookies [[COOKIES]] or session identifiers
            embedded in URLs.
          </p>
          <p>
            If not mitigated, such tracking may take three forms depending on the design of the
            [=Key System=]:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                In all cases, such identifiers are expected to be available to sites and/or servers
                that fully support the [=Key System=] (and thus can interpret [=Key System=]
                messages) enabling tracking by such sites.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                If identifiers exposed by [=Key Systems=] are not origin-specific, then two sites
                and/or servers that fully support the [=Key System=] may collude to track the user.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                If [=Key System=] messages contain information derived from a user identifier in a
                consistent manner, for example such that a portion of the initial [=Key System=]
                message for a specific content item does not change over time and is dependent on
                the user identifier, then this information could be used by any application to
                track the device or user over time.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            In addition, if a [=Key System=] permits keys or other data to be stored and to be
            re-used between origins, then it may be possible for two origins to collude and track a
            unique user by recording their ability to access a common key.
          </p>
          <p>
            Finally, if any user interface for user control of [=Key Systems=] presents data
            separately from data in HTTP session cookies [[COOKIES]] or persistent storage, then
            users are likely to modify site authorization or delete data in one and not the others.
            This would allow sites to use the various features as redundant backup for each other,
            defeating a user's attempts to protect his or her privacy.
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition to the potential for sites and other third-parties to track users, the user
            agent implementer, [=CDM=] vendor, or device vendor could build a profile of the user's
            activities or interests, such as sites using the APIs defined in this specification
            that the user visits. Such tracking would undermine the privacy protections provided by
            the rest of the web platform, especially those related to isolation of origins.
          </p>
          <p>
            Identifiers, such as [=Distinctive Identifiers=], may be obtained from a server
            operated or provided by the [=CDM=] vendor, such as via an [=individualization=]
            process. The process may include providing client identifier(s), including
            [=Distinctive Permanent Identifier(s)=], to the server. In order to generate a
            per-origin identifier, a value representing the origin may also be provided.
          </p>
          <p>
            In such an implementation, the [=CDM=] vendor may be able to track the activity of the
            user, such as number of origins visited or number of times a new identifier is
            required. If the origin or a value [=associable=] with the origin is provided in the
            identifier request, the [=CDM=] vendor could track the sites visited by the user or
            user(s) of a device.
          </p>
          <p>
            The following section describes techniques that may mitigate the risks of tracking
            without user consent.

            disabled at the same time. For example:
          </p>

            <li>
              <p>
                If a user clears cookies or other persistent storage without also clearing
                [=Distinctive Identifiers=] and data stored by Key Systems, sites can defeat those
                attempts by using the various features as redundant backup for each other.

                [=Key Systems=], including persistent sessions, as well as cookies and other

          Private Browsing Modes

          User agents may support a mode (e.g., private browsing) of operation intended to preserve
          user anonymity and/or ensure records of browsing activity are not persisted on the
          client. The privacy concerns discussed in previous sections may be especially concerning
          for users employing such modes.

        <p>
          User agent implementers that support such mode(s) SHOULD carefully consider whether
          access to [=Key Systems=] should be disabled in these mode(s). For example, such modes
          MAY prohibit creation of {{MediaKeySystemAccess}} objects that support or use
          {{MediaKeySystemConfiguration/persistentState}} or a
          {{MediaKeySystemConfiguration/distinctiveIdentifier}} (either as part of the [=CDM=]
          implementation or because the application indicated they were
          {{MediaKeysRequirement/"required"}}). If implementations do not prohibit such creation,
          they SHOULD inform the user of the implications and potential consequences for the
          expected privacy properties of such modes before allowing their use.

          Initialization is much simpler if encrypted events do not need to be handled during
          {{MediaKeys}} initialization. This can be accomplished either by providing the
          [=Initialization Data=] in other ways or setting the source after the {{MediaKeys}}
          object has been created. This example does the latter.
