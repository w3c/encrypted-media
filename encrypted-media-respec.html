      <p>This proposal extends <a def-id="htmlmediaelement"></a> [[!HTML5]] providing APIs to control playback of protected content.</p>
      <p>The API supports use cases ranging from simple clear key decryption to high value video (given an appropriate user agent implementation).
      License/key exchange is controlled by the application, facilitating the development of robust playback applications supporting a range of content decryption and protection technologies.</p>
      <p>This specification does not define a content protection or Digital Rights Management system. Rather, it defines a common API that may be used to discover, select and interact with
      such systems as well as with simpler content encryption systems. Implementation of Digital Rights Management is not required for compliance with this specification: only the
      Clear Key system is required to be implemented as a common baseline.</p>
      <p>The common API supports a simple set of content encryption capabilities, leaving application functions such as authentication and authorization to page authors. This is achieved by
      requiring content protection system-specific messaging to be mediated by the page rather than assuming out-of-band communication between the encryption system and a license
      or other server.</p>

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        This proposal allows JavaScript to select content protection mechanisms, control license/key exchange, and implement custom license management algorithms.
        It supports a wide range of use cases without requiring client-side modifications in each user agent for each use case.
        This also enables content providers to develop a single application solution for all devices.
        A generic stack implemented using the proposed APIs is shown below.
        This diagram shows an example flow: other combinations of API calls and events are possible.

          <dt id="cdm">Content Decryption Module (CDM)</dt>
          <dd>
            <p>Content Decryption Module (CDM) is a generic term for the client component that provides the functionality, including decryption, for one or more <a def-id="keysystems"></a>.</p>
            <p class="note">Implementations may or may not separate the implementations of CDMs or treat them as separate from the user agent.
            This is transparent to the API and application.</p>

            <p>All messages and communication to and from the CDM, such as between the CDM and a license server, MUST be passed through the user agent.
              The CDM MUST NOT make direct out-of band network requests.
              All messages and communication other than those covered in the following paragraph MUST be passed through the application via the APIs defined in this specification.
              Specifically, all communication that contains application-, origin-, or content-specific information or is sent to a URL specified by the application or based on its origin, MUST pass through the APIs.
              This includes all license exchange messages.              
            </p>
            <p>Application- and origin-independent messages related to per-client initialization (or reinitialization) that are sent to a fixed non-application-dependent URL MUST be handled by the user agent and MUST NOT be passed to the application via the APIs.
              The related message exchange and operations MUST be performed by the user agent via the user agent's network stack.
            </p>
            <p class="note">For example, an initialization, provisioning, or individualization process for a client device that involves communicating with a server hosted by the user agent or CDM vendor and does not contain application- or origin-specific information MUST be performed by the user agent without involving the application.
              The same applies to reinitialization, reprovisioning, or reindividualization.
            </p>
            <p>For implementations that support per-origin initialization, such messages MUST be passed to the application via the APIs.
              Such messages MUST NOT contain non-origin-specific per-client information, such as unique client identifiers.
              As with all other uses of the APIs, responses passed to the CDM MUST NOT contain executable code.
            </p>
            <p class="note">To preserve the privacy properties of per-origin initialization, applications and key system servers should not defer initialization to a non-origin-specific server.
              See <a href="#privacy-individualization">Individualization</a>.

          <dt id="key-system">Key System</dt>
          <dd>
            <p>A Key System is a generic term for a decryption mechanism and/or content protection provider.
            Key System strings provide unique identification of a Key System.
            They are used by the user agent to select a <a def-id="cdm"></a> and identify the source of a key-related event.
            User agents MUST support the <a href="#common-key-systems">Common Key Systems</a>.
            User agents MAY also provide additional CDMs with corresponding Key System strings.
            </p>
        
            <p>A Key System string is always a reverse domain name.
            Key System strings are compared using case-sensitive matching. It is RECOMMENDED that CDMs use simple lower-case ASCII key system strings.</p>
            <p class="note">For example, "com.example.somesystem".</p>
        
            <p class="note">
            Within a given system ("somesystem" in the example), subsystems may be defined as determined by the key system provider.
            For example, "com.example.somesystem.1" and "com.example.somesystem.1_5".
            Key System providers should keep in mind that these will be used for comparison and discovery, so they should be easy to compare and the structure should remain reasonably simple.

            <p>A Key Session, or simply Session, provides a context for message exchange with the CDM as a result of which key(s) are made available to the <a def-id="cdm"></a>.
            Sessions are embodied as <a def-id="mediakeysession"></a> objects.
            Each Key session is associated with a single instance of <a def-id="initialization-data"></a> provided in the <a def-id="generateRequest"></a> call.
            </p>
            <p>Each Key Session is associated with a single <a def-id="mediakeys"></a> object, and only media element(s) associated with that object may access key(s) associated with the session.
            Other <a def-id="mediakeys"></a> objects, <a def-id="cdm"></a> instances, and media elements MUST NOT access the key session or use its key(s).
            Key sessions and the keys they contain are no longer usable by the CDM for decryption when the <a href="#algorithms-session-close">session is closed</a>, including when the <a def-id="mediakeysession"></a> object is destroyed.

          </dd>
    
          <dt id="session-id">Session ID</dt>
          <dd>
            <p>A Session ID is a unique string identifier generated by the <a def-id="cdm"></a> that can be used by the application to identify <a def-id="mediakeysession"></a> objects.</p>
        
            <p>A new Session ID is generated each time the user agent and CDM successfully create a new session.</p>
        
            <p>Each Session ID SHALL be unique within the browsing context in which it was created.
              Session IDs for <a def-id="persistent-session"></a> sessions MUST be unique within the <a def-id="origin"></a> over time, including across browsing sessions.
            </p>
        
            <p class="note">The underlying content protection protocol does not necessarily need to support Session IDs.</p>

          <dt id="decryption-key">Key</dt>
          <dd>
            <p>Unless otherwise stated, key refers to a decryption key that can be used to decrypt blocks within <a def-id="media-data"></a>.
            Each such key is uniquely identified by a <a href="#decryption-key-id">key ID</a>.
            A key is associated with the <a href="#key-session">session</a> used to provide it to the CDM. (The same key may be present in multiple sessions.)
            Such keys MUST only be provided to the <a def-id="cdm"></a> via an <a def-id="update"></a> call. (They may later be loaded by <a def-id="load"></a> as part of the stored session data.)
            </p>
            
            <p>A key is considered <em>usable</em> if the CDM is certain the key is currently usable for decryption.</p>
            <p class="note">For example, a key is not usable if its license has expired.</p>
          </dd>
    
          <dt id="decryption-key-id">Key ID</dt>
          <dd>
            <p>A <a href="#decryption-key">key</a> is associated with a key ID, which uniquely identifies a key.
            The container specifies the ID of the key that can decrypt a block or set of blocks within the <a def-id="media-data"></a>.
            <a def-id="initialization-data"></a> MAY contain key ID(s) to identify the keys that are needed to decrypt the media data.
            However, there is no requirement that Initialization Data contain any or all key IDs used in the <a def-id="media-data"></a> or <a def-id="media-resource"></a>.
            <a href="#license">Licenses</a> provided to the CDM associate each key with a key ID so the <a def-id="cdm"></a> can select the appropriate key when decrypting an encrypted block of media data.

          <dt id="license">License</dt>
          <dd>
            <p>A license is key system-specific state information that includes one or more <a href="#decryption-key">key(s)</a> - each associated with a <a href="#decryption-key-id">key ID</a> - and potentially other information about key usage.</p>

            <p class="note">
            <a def-id="keysystems"></a> usually require a block of initialization data containing information about the stream to be decrypted before they can construct a license request message.
            This block could be a simple key or content ID or a more complex structure containing such information.
            It should always allow unique identification of the key(s) needed to decrypt the content.
            This initialization information MAY be obtained in some application-specific way or provided with the <a def-id="media-data"></a>.
            </p>
        
            <p>
            Initialization Data is a generic term for container-specific data that is used by a <a def-id="cdm"></a> to generate a license request.
            Initialization data found with the <a def-id="media-data"></a> is provided to the application in the <a def-id="encrypted-event-initdata-attribute"></a> attribute of the <a def-id="encrypted"></a> event.
            </p>
        
            <p>
            The format of the initialization data depends upon the type of container, and containers MAY support more than one format
            of initialization data. The <dfn id="initialization-data-type">Initialization Data Type</dfn> is a string that indicates what
            format the initialization data is provided in. Initialization Data Type strings are always matched case-sensitively. It is
            RECOMMENDED that Initialization Data Type strings are lower-case ASCII strings.
            </p>
        
            <p>
            The Encrypted Media Extensions Stream Format and Initialization Data Format Registry [[EME-REGISTRY]]
            provides the mapping from initialization data type string to the specification for each format.
            </p>

            <p>Initialization Data MUST be a fixed value for a given set of stream(s) or <a def-id="media-data"></a>.
              It MUST only contain information related to the keys required to play a given set of stream(s) or <a def-id="media-data"></a>.
              It MUST NOT contain application data, client-specific data, user-specific data, <a href="#decryption-key">key(s)</a>, or executable code.
            </p>
            
            <p>Initialization Data SHOULD NOT contain Key System-specific data or values.
              Implementations MUST support the common formats defined [[EME-REGISTRY]] for each <a def-id="initialization-data-type"></a> they support.
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              Use of proprietary formats/contents is discouraged, and supporting or using <em>only</em> proprietary formats is strongly discouraged.
              Proprietary formats should only be used with pre-existing content or on pre-existing devices that do not support the common formats.

                      is not allowed. It is also an open issue whether and how the impact of serving audio/video media over secure transport can be mitigated.

        <h3>Session Storage and Persistence</h3>
        <p>This section provides an overview of session stroage and persistence that complements the algorithms.</p>
        <p>If this object's <var title="true">session type</var> is not <a def-id="persistent-session"></a>, the user agent and CDM MUST NOT persist a record of or data related to the session at any point.
          This includes license(s), key(s), and the <a def-id="session-id"></a>.
        </p>
        <p>The remainder of this section applies to <a def-id="persistent-session"></a> sessions, which are OPTIONAL for implementatations to support.</p>
        <p>Persisted data MUST always be stored such that only the <a def-id="origin"></a> of this object's <a def-id="document-concept"></a> can access it.
          In addition, the data MUST only be accessible by the current profile of this user agent - other user agent profiles, user agents, and applications MUST NOT be able to access the stored data.
        </p>
        <p>The CDM SHOULD NOT store session data, including the Session ID, until <a def-id="update"></a> is called the first time.
          Specifically, the CDM SHOULD NOT store session data during the <a def-id="generateRequest"></a> algorithm.
          This ensures that the application is aware of the session and knows it needs to eventually remove it.
        </p>
        <p>The CDM MUST ensure that data for a given session is only present in one active unclosed session in any <a def-id="document-concept"></a>.
          In other words, <a def-id="load"></a> MUST fail when there is already a <a def-id="mediakeysession"></a> representing the session specified by the <var title="true">sessionId</var> parameter, either because the object that created it via <a def-id="generateRequest"></a> is still active or it has been loaded into another object via <a def-id="load"></a>.
          A session MAY only be loaded again after the <a def-id="session-close-algorithm"></a> has not been run on the object representing it.
        </p>
        <p>An application that creates a <a def-id="persistent-session"></a> session SHOULD later remove the stored data using <a def-id="remove"></a>.
          The CDM MAY also remove sessions as appropriate, but applications SHOULD NOT rely on this.
        </p>
        <p class="note">See the <a href="#security">Security Considerations</a> and <a href="#privacy">Privacy Considerations</a> sections for additional considerations when supporting persistent storage.</p>

        <h3>Media Element Restrictions</h3>
        <p>Media data processed by a CDM MAY be unavailable through Javascript APIs in the usual way (for example using the CanvasRenderingContext2D drawImage() method and the AudioContext MediaElementAudioSourceNode).
        This specification does not define conditions for such non-availability of media data, however, if media data is not available to Javascript APIs then these APIs MAY behave as if no media data was present at all.</p>
        <p>Where media rendering is not performed by the UA, for example in the case of a hardware protected media pipeline, then the full set of HTML rendering capabilities, for example CSS Transforms, MAY be unavailable. One likely restriction is that
        video media MAY be constrained to appear only in rectangular regions with sides parallel to the edges of the window and with normal orientation.</p>

      <h2>Security Considerations</h2>
  
      <p>User Agent and Key System implementations must consider <a def-id="media-data"></a>, <a def-id="initialization-data"></a>, responses (i.e. data passed to <a def-id="update"></a>), licenses, key data, and all other data provided by the application as untrusted content and potential attack vectors.
      They must use appropriate safeguards to mitigate any associated threats and take care to safely parse, decrypt, etc. such data.
      User Agents SHOULD validate data before passing it to the CDM, especially if the CDM does not run in the same (sandboxed) context as the DOM (i.e. rendering).
      </p>
      <p>Implementations MUST NOT return active content or passive content that affects program control flow to the application.
      For example, it is not safe to expose URLs or other information that may have come from media data, such as is the case for the <a def-id="initialization-data"></a> passed to <a def-id="generateRequest"></a>.
      Applications must determine the URLs to use. The <a def-id="message-event-messagetype-attribute"></a> attribute of the <a def-id="message"></a> event can be used by the application to select among a set of URLs if applicable.
      </p>
      <p>User Agents are responsible for providing users with a secure way to browse the web. Since User Agents may integrate with third party CDM implementations, CDM implementers must provide sufficient information and controls to user agent implementers to enable them to properly asses the security implications of integrating with the Key System.</p>
      <p>Unsandboxed CDMs (or CDMs that use platform features) and UAs that use them must be especially careful in all areas of security, including parsing of key and media data, etc. due to the potential for compromises to provide access to OS/platform features, interact with or run as root, access drivers, kernel, firmware, hardware, etc., all of which may not be written to be robust against hostile software or web-based attacks. Additionally, CDMs may not be updated with security fixes as frequently, especially when part of the OS, platform or hardware.</p>
  
      <p>User agents may choose to only support the EME APIs and/or specific Key Systems (i.e. based on privacy and security risks) on secure origins.
      This is especially important if a user agent chooses to support a Key System implementation that cannot be sufficiently sandboxed or otherwise secured.
      Such user agents should also properly handle Mixed Content [[MIXED-CONTENT]] to avoid potential exposure to insecure content.
      See also <a href="#privacy-secureorigin">Use Secure Origin and Transport</a>.
      </p>
      
      <p>If a user agent chooses to support a Key System implementation that cannot be sufficiently sandboxed or otherwise secured, the user agent should ensure that users are fully informed and/or give explicit consent before loading or invoking it.

      <h2>Privacy Considerations</h2>
  
      <p>The presence or use of Key Systems on a user's device raises a number of privacy issues, falling into two categories: (a) user-specific information that may be disclosed by the EME interface itself, or within messages from Key Systems and (b) user-specific information that may be persistently stored on the users device.</p>
      <p>User Agents should take responsibility for providing users with adequate control over their own privacy. Since User Agents may integrate with third party CDM implementations, CDM implementers must provide sufficient information and controls to user agent implementers to enable them to implement appropriate techniques to ensure users have control over their privacy, including but not limited to the techniques described below.</p>
  
      <section id="privacy-disclosure">
        <h3>Information Disclosed by EME and Key Systems</h3>
        <p>Concerns regarding information disclosed by EME and Key Systems fall into two categories, concerns about non-specific information that may nevertheless contribute to the possibility of fingerprinting a user agent or device and user-specific information that may be used directly for user tracking.</p>
      </section>
  
      <section id="privacy-fingerprinting">
        <h4>Fingerprinting</h4>
        <p>Malicious applications may be able to fingerprint users or user agents by detecting or enumerating the list of Key Systems that are supported and related information. If proper origin protections are not provided this could include detection of sites that have been visited and information stored for those sites. In particular, Key Systems MUST not share key or other data between origins.</p>
      </section>
  
      <section id="privacy-leakage">
        <h4>Information Leakage</h4>
        <p>CDMs, especially those implemented outside the user agent, may not have the same fundamental isolations as the web platform.
        It is important that steps be taken to avoid information leakage, especially across origins.
        This includes both in-memory and stored data.
        Failure to do so could lead to information leakage to/from Incognito/Private Browsing sessions, across profiles, and even across different browsers, applications, and operating system user accounts.
        </p>
        
        <p>To avoid such issues, user agent and CDM implementations MUST ensure that:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>CDMs have a concept of a CDM instance that is associated 1:1 with a MediaKeys object.</li>
          <li>Keys, licenses, other session data, and the presence of sessions are restricted to the CDM instance associated with the MediaKeys object that created the session.</li>
          <li>Session data is not shared between MediaKeys objects or CDM instances.</li>
          <li>Session data is not shared with media elements not associated with the MediaKeys object that created the session. Among other things, this means a session's keys MUST not be used to decrypt content loaded by a media element whose <a def-id="mediaKeys-attribute"></a> attribute is not that MediaKeys object.</li>
          <li>MediaKeys objects and the underlying implementation do not expose information outside the origin.</li>
          <li>Persisted session data, if applicable, is stored on a per-origin basis.</li>
          <li>Only data stored by the requesting origin may be loaded.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
  
      <section id="privacy-tracking">
        <h4>Tracking</h4>
        <p>User-specific information may be obtained over the EME API in two ways: through detection of stored keys and through Key System messages.</p>
    
        <p>Key Systems may access or create persistent or semi-persistent identifiers for a device or user of a device. In some cases these identifiers may be bound to a specific device in a secure manner. If these identifiers are present in Key System messages, then devices and/or users may be tracked. If the mitigations below are not applied this could include both tracking of users / devices over time and associating multiple users of a given device. If not mitigated, such tracking may take three forms depending on the design of the Key System:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>In all cases, such identifiers are expected to be available to sites and/or servers that fully support the Key System (and thus can interpret Key System messages) enabling tracking by such sites.</li>
          <li>If identifiers exposed by Key Systems are not origin-specific, then two sites and/or servers that fully support the Key System may collude to track the user</li>
          <li>If a Key System messages contains information derived from a user identifier in a consistent manner, for example such that a portion of the initial Key System message for a specific content item does not change over time and is dependent on the user identifier, then this information could be used by any application to track the device or user over time.</li>
        </ul>
    
        <p>If a Key System permits keys to be stored and to be re-used between origins, then it may be possible for two origins to collude and track a unique user by recording their ability to access a common key.</p>
        <p>Finally, if any user interface for user control of Key Systems presents data separately from data in HTTP session cookies or persistent storage, then users are likely to modify site authorization or delete data in one and not the others. This would allow sites to use the various features as redundant backup for each other, defeating a user's attempts to protect his privacy.</p>
        <p>There are a number of techniques that can be used to mitigate these risks of tracking without user consent:</p>
    
        <dl>
          <dt>User deletion of persistent identifiers</dt>
          <dd>User agents could provide users with the ability to clear any persistent identifiers maintained by Key Systems.</dd>
    
          <dt>Use of (non-reversible) per-origin identifiers</dt>
          <dd>The user / device identifier exposed by a Key System may be different for each origin, either by allocation of different identifiers for different origins or by use of a non-reversible origin-specific mapping from an origin-independent identifier.</dd>
    
          <dt id="identifier-encryption">Encryption of user identifiers</dt>
          <dd>User identifiers in Key System messages could be encrypted, together with a timestamp or nonce, such that the Key System messages are always different. This would prevent the use of Key System messages for tracking except by applications fully supporting the Key System.
          This MAY be implemented using a <a href="#server-certificate">server certificate</a>.
          </dd>
    
          <dt>Site-specific white-listing of access to each Key System</dt>
          <dd>User agents could require the user to explicitly authorize access by each site to each Key System. User agents should enable users to revoke this authorization either temporarily or permanently.</dd>
    
          <dt>Treating Key System persistent identifiers as cookies</dt>
          <dd>User agents should present the presence of persistent identifiers stored by Key Systems to the user in a way that associates them strongly with HTTP session cookies. This might encourage users to view such identifiers with healthy suspicion.</dd>
    
          <dt>Shared blacklists</dt>
          <dd>User agents may allow users to share their Key System domain blacklists. This would allow communities to act together to protect their privacy.</dd>
    
          <dt id="privacy-prompts">User Alerts / Prompts</dt>
          <dd>User Agents should ensure that users are fully informed and/or give explicit consent before identifiers are exposed in messages from Key Systems.
            Such alerts and consent should be per origin to avoid valid uses enabling subsequent malicious access.
            User agents that consider such alerts or consent appropriate should only support such Key Systems on secure origins (see <a href="#privacy-secureorigin">Use Secure Origin and Transport</a>), especially if they allow such consent to be persisted.
            (Granting permissions to unauthenticated origins is equivalent to granting the permissions to any origin in the presence of a network attacker.)
          </dd>
    
          <dt>User controls to disable Key Systems or Key System use of identifiers</dt>
          <dd>User Agents could provide users with a global control of whether a Key System is enabled / disabled and/or whether Key System use of user / device identifiers is enabled or disabled (if supported by the Key System).</dd>
        </dl>
    
        <p>While these suggestions prevent trivial use of this feature for user tracking, they do not block it altogether. Within a single domain, a site can continue to track the user during a session, and can then pass all this information to a third party along with any identifying information (names, credit card numbers, addresses) obtained by the site. If a third party cooperates with multiple sites to obtain such information, and if identifiers are not per-origin, then a profile can still be created.</p>
        <p>It is important to note that identifiers that are non-clearable, non-origin-specific or hardware-bound exceed the tracking impact of existing techniques such as cookies or session identifiers embedded in URLs.</p>
        <p>Thus, in addition to the various mitigations described above, if a browser supports a mode of operation intended to preserve user anonymity, then User Agent implementers should carefully consider whether access to Key Systems should be disabled in this mode.
          For example, such modes MAY prohibit creation of <a>MediaKeySystemAccess</a> objects that are <a def-id="option-stateful"></a> or use a <a def-id="option-uniqueidentifier"></a> (either as part of the CDM implementation or because the application <a def-id="requirement-required"></a> them).
        </p>

        <section id="privacy-individualization">
          <h5>Individualization</h5>
          <p>Identifiers are sometimes obtained via a process called individualization or provisioning.
            In all cases, implementations should avoid sending per-origin information to centralized servers since this could create a central record of all origins visited by a user or device.
          </p>
          <p>Per-origin individualization (resulting in a per-origin identifier) can - with appropriate precautions - provide better privacy than other individualization models. 
            To preserve the benefits of such a design and to avoid introducing other privacy concerns:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><p>Such implementations should not use identifiers for a device or user of a device in the individualization process.</p></li>
            <li><p>Such implementations and the applications that support them should also avoid deferring or forwarding the individualization process to a central server or other server not controlled by the application author.</p></li>

      <section id="privacy-storedinfo">
        <h3>Information Stored on User Devices</h3>
        <p>Key Systems may store information on a user's device, or user agents may store information on behalf of Key Systems. Potentially, this could reveal information about a user to another user of the same device, including potentially the origins that have used a particular Key System (i.e. sites visited) or even the content that has been decrypted using a Key System.</p>
        <p>If information stored by one origin affects the operation of the Key System for another origin, then potentially the sites visited or content viewed by a user on one site may be revealed to another, potentially malicious, site.</p>
        <p>There are a number of techniques that can be used to mitigate these privacy risk to users:</p>

            Session data, licenses, and keys that are persistently stored MUST be stored per-origin.
            See <a def-id="session-storage"></a>.
          </dd>
    
          <dt>User deletion of Key System storage</dt>
          <dd>User agents should present the user with a way to delete Key System storage for a specific origin or all origins.</dd>
    
          <dt>Treating Key System stored data like cookies / Web Storage</dt>
          <dd>User agents should present the presence of persistent data stored by Key Systems to the user in a way that associates it strongly with HTTP session cookies and/or Web Storage. This might encourage users to view such data with healthy suspicion.</dd>
    
          <dt>Encryption or obfuscation of Key System stored data</dt>
          <dd>User agents should treat data stored by Key Systems as potentially sensitive; it is quite possible for user privacy to be compromised by the release of this information. To this end, user agents should ensure that such data is securely stored and when deleting data, it is promptly deleted from the underlying storage.</dd>
        </dl>
        
        <p>User agent and CDM implementations that allow the CDM to persist data:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>MUST ensure it is restricted to the origin for which it was created.</li>
