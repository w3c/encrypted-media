    <section id="abstract">
      <p>This proposal extends <a def-id="htmlmediaelement"></a> [[!HTML5]] providing APIs to control playback of protected content.</p>
      <p>The API supports use cases ranging from simple clear key decryption to high value video (given an appropriate user agent implementation).
      License/key exchange is controlled by the application, facilitating the development of robust playback applications supporting a range of content decryption and protection technologies.</p>
      <p>This specification does not define a content protection or Digital Rights Management system. Rather, it defines a common API that may be used to discover, select and interact with
      such systems as well as with simpler content encryption systems. Implementation of Digital Rights Management is not required for compliance with this specification: only the
      Clear Key system is required to be implemented as a common baseline.</p>
      <p>The common API supports a simple set of content encryption capabilities, leaving application functions such as authentication and authorization to page authors. This is achieved by
      requiring content protection system-specific messaging to be mediated by the page rather than assuming out-of-band communication between the encryption system and a license
      or other server.</p>

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        This specification enables script to select content protection mechanisms, control license/key exchange, and implement custom license management algorithms.
        It supports a wide range of use cases without requiring client-side modifications in each user agent for each use case.
        This enables content providers to develop a single application solution for all devices.
      </p>
      <p>
        Supported content is encrypted per container-specific "common encryption" specifications, enabling use across key systems.
        Supported content has an unencrypted container, enabling metadata to be provided to the application and maintaining compatibility with other <a def-id="htmlmediaelement"></a> features.
      </p>
      <p>
        A generic stack implemented using the API is shown below.
        This diagram shows an example flow; other combinations of API calls and events are possible.

      <h2>Definitions</h2>

      <dl>
        <dt id="cdm">Content Decryption Module (CDM)</dt>
        <dd>
          <p>Content Decryption Module (CDM) is the client component that provides the functionality, including decryption, for one or more <a def-id="keysystems"></a>.</p>
          <p class="note">Implementations may or may not separate the implementations of CDMs or treat them as separate from the user agent.
          This is transparent to the API and application.</p>

          <p>All messages and communication to and from the CDM, such as between the CDM and a license server, MUST be passed through the user agent.
            The CDM MUST NOT make direct out-of band network requests.
            All messages and communication other than those described in <a href="#origin-independent-individualization">Origin-Independent Individualization</a> MUST be passed through the application via the APIs defined in this specification.
            Specifically, all communication that contains application-, <a def-id="origin"></a>-, or content-specific information or is sent to a URL specified by the application or based on its origin, MUST pass through the APIs.
            This includes all license exchange messages.
          </p>
        </dd>

        <dt id="key-system">Key System</dt>
        <dd>
          <p>A Key System is a generic term for a decryption mechanism and/or content protection provider.
          Key System strings provide unique identification of a Key System.
          They are used by the user agent to select a <a def-id="cdm"></a> and identify the source of a key-related event.
          User agents MUST support the <a href="#common-key-systems">Common Key Systems</a>.
          User agents MAY also provide additional CDMs with corresponding Key System strings.
          </p>

          <p>A Key System string is always a reverse domain name.
          Key System strings are compared using case-sensitive matching. It is RECOMMENDED that CDMs use simple lower-case ASCII key system strings.</p>
          <p class="note">For example, "com.example.somesystem".</p>

          <p class="note">
          Within a given system ("somesystem" in the example), subsystems may be defined as determined by the key system provider.
          For example, "com.example.somesystem.1" and "com.example.somesystem.1_5".
          Key System providers should keep in mind that these will be used for comparison and discovery, so they should be easy to compare and the structure should remain reasonably simple.
          </p>
        </dd>

        <dt id="key-session">Key Session</dt>
        <dd>
          <p>A Key Session, or simply Session, provides a context for message exchange with the CDM as a result of which key(s) are made available to the <a def-id="cdm"></a>.
          Sessions are embodied as <a>MediaKeySession</a> objects.
          Each Key session is associated with a single instance of <a def-id="initialization-data"></a> provided in the <a def-id="generateRequest"></a> call.
          </p>
          <p>Each Key Session is associated with a single <a>MediaKeys</a> object, and only media element(s) associated with that object may access key(s) associated with the session.
          Other <a>MediaKeys</a> objects, <a def-id="cdm"></a> instances, and media elements MUST NOT access the key session or use its key(s).
          Key sessions and the keys they contain are no longer usable by the CDM for decryption when the <a def-id="session-close-algorithm">session is closed</a>, including when the <a>MediaKeySession</a> object is destroyed.
          </p>
          <p><a def-id="key-id">Key IDs</a> MUST be unique within a session.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt id="session-id">Session ID</dt>
        <dd>
          <p>A Session ID is a unique string identifier generated by the <a def-id="cdm"></a> that can be used by the application to identify <a>MediaKeySession</a> objects.</p>

          <p>A new Session ID is generated each time the user agent and CDM successfully create a new session.</p>

          <p>Each Session ID SHALL be unique within the browsing context in which it was created.
            For session types for which the <a def-id="is-persistent-session-type-algorithm"></a> algorithm returns <code>true</code>, Session IDs MUST be unique within the <a def-id="origin"></a> over time, including across browsing sessions.
          </p>

          <p class="note">The underlying content protection protocol does not necessarily need to support Session IDs.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt id="decryption-key">Key</dt>
        <dd>
          <p>Unless otherwise stated, key refers to a decryption key that can be used to decrypt blocks within <a def-id="media-data"></a>.
          Each such key is uniquely identified by a <a def-id="key-id"></a>.
          A key is associated with the <a href="#key-session">session</a> used to provide it to the CDM. (The same key may be present in multiple sessions.)
          Such keys MUST only be provided to the <a def-id="cdm"></a> via an <a def-id="update"></a> call. (They may later be loaded by <a def-id="load"></a> as part of the stored session data.)
          </p>

          <p>A key is considered <em>usable</em> if the CDM is certain the key is currently usable to decrypt <a def-id="media-data"></a></p>
          <p class="note">For example, a key is not usable if its license has expired.</p>
          
          <p class="note">Authors SHOULD encrypt each set of stream(s) that requires enforcement of a meaningfully different policy with a distinct key (and key ID).
            For example, if policies may differ between two video resolutions, stream(s) containing one resolution should not be encrypted with the key used to encrypt stream(s) containing the other resolution.
            When encrypted, audio streams SHOULD NOT use the same key as any video stream.
            This is the only way to ensure enforcement and compatibility across clients.
          </p>
        </dd>

        <dt id="decryption-key-id">Key ID</dt>
        <dd>
          <p>A <a href="#decryption-key">key</a> is associated with a key ID, which uniquely identifies a key.
          The container specifies the ID of the key that can decrypt a block or set of blocks within the <a def-id="media-data"></a>.
          <a def-id="initialization-data"></a> MAY contain key ID(s) to identify the keys that are needed to decrypt the media data.
          However, there is no requirement that Initialization Data contain any or all key IDs used in the <a def-id="media-data"></a> or <a def-id="media-resource"></a>.
          <a href="#license">Licenses</a> provided to the CDM associate each key with a key ID so the <a def-id="cdm"></a> can select the appropriate key when decrypting an encrypted block of media data.
          </p>
        </dd>

        <dt id="known-key">Known Key</dt>
        <dd>
          <p>A key is considered to be known to a session if the CDM's implementation of the session contains any information - specifically the <a def-id="key-id"></a> - about it, regardless of whether the actual <a href="#decryption-key">key</a> is usable or its value is known.
            Known keys are exposed via the <a def-id="keyStatuses"></a> attribute.
          </p>

          <p>Keys are considered known even after they become unusable, such as due to expiration.
            Keys only become unknown when they are explicitly removed from a session.
          </p>

          <p class="note">For example, a key could become unknown if an <a def-id="update"></a> call provides a new license that does not include the key and includes instructions to replace the license(s) that previously contained the key.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt id="license">License</dt>
        <dd>
          <p>A license is key system-specific state information that includes one or more <a href="#decryption-key">key(s)</a> - each associated with a <a def-id="key-id"></a> - and potentially other information about key usage.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt id="initialization-data">Initialization Data</dt>
        <dd>
          <p class="note">
          <a def-id="keysystems"></a> usually require a block of initialization data containing information about the stream to be decrypted before they can construct a license request message.
          This block could be a simple key or content ID or a more complex structure containing such information.
          It should always allow unique identification of the key(s) needed to decrypt the content.
          This initialization information MAY be obtained in some application-specific way or provided with the <a def-id="media-data"></a>.
          </p>

          <p>
          Initialization Data is a generic term for container-specific data that is used by a <a def-id="cdm"></a> to generate a license request.
          Initialization data found with the <a def-id="media-data"></a> is provided to the application in the <a def-id="encrypted-event-initdata-attribute"></a> attribute of the <a def-id="encrypted"></a> event.
          </p>

          <p>
          The format of the initialization data depends upon the type of container, and containers MAY support more than one format
          of initialization data. The <dfn id="initialization-data-type">Initialization Data Type</dfn> is a string that indicates what
          format the initialization data is provided in. Initialization Data Type strings are always matched case-sensitively. It is
          RECOMMENDED that Initialization Data Type strings are lower-case ASCII strings.
          </p>

          <p>
          The Encrypted Media Extensions Stream Format and Initialization Data Format Registry [[EME-REGISTRY]]
          provides the mapping from initialization data type string to the specification for each format.
          </p>

          <p>Initialization Data MUST be a fixed value for a given set of stream(s) or <a def-id="media-data"></a>.
            It MUST only contain information related to the keys required to play a given set of stream(s) or <a def-id="media-data"></a>.
            It MUST NOT contain application data, client-specific data, user-specific data, <a href="#decryption-key">key(s)</a>, or executable code.
          </p>

          <p>Initialization Data SHOULD NOT contain Key System-specific data or values.
            Implementations MUST support the common formats defined [[EME-REGISTRY]] for each <a def-id="initialization-data-type"></a> they support.
          </p>
          <p class="note">
            Use of proprietary formats/contents is discouraged, and supporting or using <em>only</em> proprietary formats is strongly discouraged.
            Proprietary formats should only be used with pre-existing content or on pre-existing devices that do not support the common formats.
          </p>

        <dt id="distinctive-identifier">Distinctive Identifier</dt>
        <dd>
          <p>A distinctive identifier is a piece of data, implication of the possession of a piece of data, or an observable behavior or timing for which all of the following criteria hold:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><p>It is not shared across a large population of users or devices.</p></li>
            <li><p>It is exposed outside the client device or exposed to the application such that the application has the opportunity to send it (even if in encrypted form if decryptable outside the device) or information about it outside the client device.</p></li>
            <li><p>It is used in more than one session or <!-- TODO: Get clarity on this: -->is potentially used in one persistent session across the point of persistence.</p></li>
          </ul>

          <p class="note">A distinctive identifier is typically unique to a user or device, but an identifier does not need to be strictly unique to be distinctive.
            For example, an identifier shared among a small number of users could still be distinctive.
          </p>

          <div class="note">
            <p>Examples of distinctive identifiers include but are not limited to:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><p>A string of bytes that is included in key requests and that is different from the string included by other devices.</p></li>
              <li><p>A public key included in key requests that is different from the public keys included in the requests by other devices.</p></li>
              <li><p>Demonstration of possession of a private key (e.g. by signing some data) that other devices do not have.</p></li>
              <li><p>An identifier for such a key.</p></li>

              <li><p>A nonce or ephemeral key that is unique but used in only one <!-- TODO: Get clarity on this: "non-persistent" --> session.</p></li>
              <li><p>Device-unique keys used in attestations between, for example, the video pipeline and the CDM when the CDM does not let these attestations further flow to the application and instead makes a new attestation on its own using a key that does not constitute a distinctive identifier.</p></li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <p class="note">The source of the identifier does not affect whether it is distinctive.
            For example, an identifier that is permanently part of the client device, contained in the CDM, generated on the client, or generated as part of some individualization or other provisioning process is considered distinctive if it meets the criteria above.

            <p class="note">Unrecognized dictionary members in <var>candidate configuration</var> are ignored per [[WebIDL]] and will never reach this algorithm. Thus, they cannot be considered as part of the configuration.</p>

                </p>

                          String comparison is case-sensitive.
                          The empty string is never supported.

                        <p class="note">The <var>initDataType</var> MUST be supported independent of content types in order to avoid unexpectedly rejecting the configuration in later steps.
                          Support for <var>initDataType</var> includes both license generation and, when appropriate, extraction from media data.

        <h3>Session Storage and Persistence</h3>
        <p>This section provides an overview of session stroage and persistence that complements the algorithms.</p>
        <p>If the result of running the <a def-id="is-persistent-session-type-algorithm"></a> algorithm on this object's <var>session type</var> is <code>false</code>, the user agent and CDM MUST NOT persist a record of or data related to the session at any point.
          This includes license(s), key(s), records or proof of license destruction, and the <a def-id="session-id"></a>.
        </p>
        <p>The remainder of this section applies to session types for which the <a def-id="is-persistent-session-type-algorithm"></a> algorithm returns <code>true</code>.</p>
        <p>Persisted data MUST always be stored such that only the <a def-id="origin"></a> of this object's <a def-id="document-concept"></a> can access it.
          In addition, the data MUST only be accessible by the current profile of this user agent; other user agent profiles, user agents, and applications MUST NOT be able to access the stored data.
          See <a href="#privacy-storedinfo">Information Stored on User Devices</a>.
        </p>
        <p>The CDM SHOULD NOT store session data, including the Session ID, until <a def-id="update"></a> is called the first time.
          Specifically, the CDM SHOULD NOT store session data during the <a def-id="generateRequest"></a> algorithm.
          This ensures that the application is aware of the session and knows it needs to eventually remove it.
        </p>
        <p>The CDM MUST ensure that data for a given session is only present in one active unclosed session in any <a def-id="document-concept"></a>.
          In other words, <a def-id="load"></a> MUST fail when there is already a <a>MediaKeySession</a> representing the session specified by the <var>sessionId</var> parameter, either because the object that created it via <a def-id="generateRequest"></a> is still active or it has been loaded into another object via <a def-id="load"></a>.
          A session MAY only be loaded again after the <a def-id="session-close-algorithm"></a> algorithm has not been run on the object representing it.
        </p>
        <p>An application that creates a session using a type for which the <a def-id="is-persistent-session-type-algorithm"></a> algorithm returns <code>true</code> SHOULD later remove the stored data using <a def-id="remove"></a>.
          The CDM MAY also remove sessions as appropriate, but applications SHOULD NOT rely on this.
        </p>
        <p>See the <a href="#security">Security</a> and <a href="#privacy">Privacy</a> sections for additional considerations when supporting persistent storage.</p>

      <p>When a <a def-id="htmlmediaelement"></a> is created, its internal <var>waiting for key</var> value is initialized to <code>false</code>.</p>

      <p>For methods that return a promise, all errors are reported asynchronously by rejecting the returned Promise. This includes [[!WebIDL]] type mapping errors.</p>

        <p>Media data processed by a CDM MAY be unavailable through Javascript APIs in the usual way (for example using the CanvasRenderingContext2D drawImage() method and the AudioContext MediaElementAudioSourceNode).
        This specification does not define conditions for such non-availability of media data, however, if media data is not available to Javascript APIs then these APIs MAY behave as if no media data was present at all.</p>
        <p>Where media rendering is not performed by the UA, for example in the case of a hardware protected media pipeline, then the full set of HTML rendering capabilities, for example CSS Transforms, MAY be unavailable. One likely restriction is that

          Such features, software, and hardware may not be written to be robust against hostile software or web-based attacks and may not be updated with security fixes, especially compared to the user agent.
          Lack of, infrequent, or slow updates for fixes to security vulnerabilities in CDM implementations increases the risk.
          Such CDM implementations and UAs that expose them MUST be especially careful in all areas of security, including parsing of <a href="#input-data-security">all data</a>.

          <p>Authors are RECOMMENDED to prevent other entities from hosting their applications in <code>iframe</code>s.
            Applications that must support being hosted for legitimate application-design reasons SHOULD NOT allow hosting documents to provide <a href="#input-data-security">any data to be passed to the CDM</a> - either via these APIs or as media data - and SHOULD NOT allow hosting frames to invoke these APIs.

        <p>Using these APIs on shared hosts compromises origin-based security and privacy mitigations implemented by user agents.
          For example, per-origin <a def-id="distinctive-identifiers"></a> are shared by all authors on one host name, and peristed data may be accessed and manipulated by any author on the host.

          <p>CDMs, especially those implemented outside the user agent, may not have the same fundamental isolations as the web platform.
            It is important that steps be taken to avoid information leakage, especially across origins.
            This includes both in-memory and stored data.
            Failure to do so could lead to information leakage to/from private browsing sessions, across profiles, and even across different browsers, applications, and operating system user accounts.

        <section>
          <h4>Mitigations</h4>
          <p>To avoid such issues, user agent and CDM implementations MUST ensure that:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><p>CDMs have a concept of a CDM instance that is associated one-to-one with a MediaKeys object.</p></li>
            <li><p>Keys, licenses, other session data, and the presence of sessions are restricted to the CDM instance associated with the MediaKeys object that created the session.</p></li>
            <li><p>Session data is not shared between MediaKeys objects or CDM instances.</p></li>
            <li><p>Session data is not shared with media elements not associated with the MediaKeys object that created the session.
              Among other things, this means a session's keys MUST not be used to decrypt content loaded by a media element whose <a def-id="mediaKeys-attribute"></a> attribute is not that MediaKeys object.
            </p></li>
            <li><p>MediaKeys objects and the underlying implementation do not expose information outside the <a def-id="origin"></a>.</p></li>
            <li><p>Persisted session data, if applicable, is stored on a per-<a def-id="origin"></a> basis.</p></li>

        <h3>User Tracking</h3>
        <section class="informative">
          <h4>Concerns</h4>
          <p>A third-party host (or any entity, such as an advertiser, capable of getting content distributed to multiple sites) could use a <a def-id="distinctive-identifier"></a> or data, including keys, stored in the <a def-id="cdm"></a>'s client-side database to track a user across multiple sessions (including across profiles and user accounts on the client device), building a profile of the user's activities or interests.
            Such tracking would undermine the privacy protections provided by the rest of the web platform and could, for example, enable highly-targeted advertising not otherwise possible.
            In conjunction with a site that is aware of the user's real identity (for example, a content provider or e-commerce site that requires authenticated credentials), this could allow oppressive groups to target individuals with greater accuracy than in a world with purely anonymous Web usage.
          </p>

          <p>User- or client-specific information that could be obtained via the APIs in this specification includes:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><p><a def-id="distinctive-identifier">Distinctive Identifier(s)</a></p></li>
            <li><p>Origins visisted (via stored or in-memory data, permissions, etc.)</p></li>
            <li><p>Content viewed (via stored or in-memory keys, key IDs, data, etc.)</p></li>
          </ul>
          <p>This specification presents a specific concern because such information is commonly stored outside the user agent (and its profile storage), often in the CDM.</p>

          <p>Key Systems may access or create persistent or semi-persistent identifier(s), <a def-id="distinctive-identifier">Distinctive Identifier(s)</a>, for a device or user of a device.
            In some cases these identifiers may be bound to a specific device in a secure manner.
            If these identifiers are present in Key System messages, then devices and/or users may be tracked.
            If the mitigations below are not applied this could include both tracking of users / devices over time and associating multiple users of a given device.
          </p>

          <p>It is important to note that such identifiers, especially those that are non-clearable, non-<a def-id="origin"></a>-specific or hardware-bound, exceed the tracking impact of existing techniques such as cookies [[COOKIES]] or session identifiers embedded in URLs.</p>

          <p>If not mitigated, such tracking may take three forms depending on the design of the Key System:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><p>In all cases, such identifiers are expected to be available to sites and/or servers that fully support the Key System (and thus can interpret Key System messages) enabling tracking by such sites.</p></li>
            <li><p>If identifiers exposed by Key Systems are not origin-specific, then two sites and/or servers that fully support the Key System may collude to track the user.</p></li>
            <li><p>If Key System messages contain information derived from a user identifier in a consistent manner, for example such that a portion of the initial Key System message for a specific content item does not change over time and is dependent on the user identifier, then this information could be used by any application to track the device or user over time.</p></li>
          </ul>

          <p>In addition, if a Key System permits keys to be stored and to be re-used between origins, then it may be possible for two origins to collude and track a unique user by recording their ability to access a common key.</p>
          <p>Finally, if any user interface for user control of Key Systems presents data separately from data in HTTP session cookies [[COOKIES]] or persistent storage, then users are likely to modify site authorization or delete data in one and not the others.
            This would allow sites to use the various features as redundant backup for each other, defeating a user's attempts to protect his privacy.

          <h4>Mitigations</h4>
          <p>User agents SHOULD present the interfaces for clearing <a def-id="distinctive-identifiers"></a> and Key System stored data in a way that helps users to understand this possibility and enables them to delete data in all persistent identification and storage features, including HTTP session cookies [[!COOKIES]] and web storage, simultaneously.
            Likewise, User agents SHOULD present the interfaces for disabling and re-enabling a Key System in a way that helps users to understand this possibility and enables them to delete all such data in all persistent storage features simultaneously.

        <h3>Private Browsing Modes</h3>
        <p>User agents may support a mode (e.g. private browsing) of operation intended to preserve user anonymity and/or ensure records of browsing activity are not persisted on the client.
          The privacy concerns discussed in previous sections may be expecially concerning for users employing such modes.
        </p>
        <p>User agent implementers that support such mode(s) SHOULD carefully consider whether access to Key Systems should be disabled in these mode(s).
          For example, such modes MAY prohibit creation of <a>MediaKeySystemAccess</a> objects that support or use <a def-id="option-persistentState"></a> or a <a def-id="option-distinctiveIdentifier"></a> (either as part of the CDM implementation or because the application indicated they were <a def-id="requirement-required"></a>).
          If implementations do not prohibit such creation, they SHOULD inform the user of the implications and potential consequences for the expected privacy properties of such modes before allowing their use.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="privacy-secureorigin">
        <h3>Secure Origin and Transport</h3>
        <p>In order to protect identifiers and other information discussed in previous sections, user agents MAY choose to only support these APIs and/or specific Key Systems (i.e. based on privacy and security risks) on secure origins.
        This is especially important if a user agent chooses to support a Key System implementation that expose <a def-id="distinctive-identifiers"></a> or other such information without effectively anonymizing it in transit.
        </p>
        <p>Regardless of user agent limitations, applications SHOULD use secure transport (e.g. HTTPS) for all traffic containing messages from the CDM (i.e. all data passed from <a def-id="message"></a> events and to <a def-id="update"></a>).</p>
        <p>All user agents MUST properly handle Mixed Content [[!MIXED-CONTENT]] to avoid exposure to insecure content or transport when the user agent or application wish to enforce secure origin and transport.</p>
