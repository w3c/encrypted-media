    <section id="abstract">
      <p>This proposal extends <a def-id="htmlmediaelement"></a> [[HTML]] providing APIs to control playback of encrypted content.</p>
      <p>The API supports use cases ranging from simple clear key decryption to high value video (given an appropriate user agent implementation).
      License/key exchange is controlled by the application, facilitating the development of robust playback applications supporting a range of content decryption and protection technologies.</p>
      <p>This specification does not define a content protection or Digital Rights Management system. Rather, it defines a common API that may be used to discover, select and interact with
      such systems as well as with simpler content encryption systems. Implementation of Digital Rights Management is not required for compliance with this specification: only the
      Clear Key system is required to be implemented as a common baseline.</p>
      <p>The common API supports a simple set of content encryption capabilities, leaving application functions such as authentication and authorization to page authors. This is achieved by
      requiring content protection system-specific messaging to be mediated by the page rather than assuming out-of-band communication between the encryption system and a license
      or other server.</p>

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        This specification enables script to select content protection mechanisms, control license/key exchange, and
        execute custom license management algorithms.
        It supports a wide range of use cases without requiring client-side modifications in each user agent for each use case.
        This enables content providers to develop a single application solution for all devices.
      </p>
      <p>
        Supported content is encrypted per container-specific "common encryption" specifications, enabling use across key systems.
        Supported content has an unencrypted container, enabling metadata to be provided to the application and maintaining compatibility with other <a def-id="htmlmediaelement"></a> features.
      </p>
      <p>
        Implementers should pay attention to the mitigations for the security and privacy threats and concerns described in this specification.
        In particular, the specification requirements for security and privacy cannot be met without knowledge of the security and privacy properties of the <a def-id="keysystem"></a> and its implementation(s).
        <a href="#implementation-requirements"></a> contains security and privacy provisions related to the integration and use of underlying <a def-id="keysystem"></a> implementations.
        <a href="#security"></a> focuses on external threats, such as input data or network attacks.
        <a href="#privacy"></a> focuses on the handling of user-specific information and providing users with adequate control over their own privacy.
      </p>
      <p class="note">
        While this specification is independent of the source of the media data, authors should be aware that many implementations only support decrypting media data provided via Media Source Extensions [[MEDIA-SOURCE]].
      </p>
      <p>
        A generic stack implemented using the API is shown below.
        This diagram shows an example flow; other combinations of API calls and events are possible.

        <dt id="cdm">Content Decryption Module (CDM)</dt>
        <dd>
          <p>Content Decryption Module (CDM) is the client component that provides the functionality, including decryption, for one or more <a def-id="keysystems"></a>.</p>
          <p class="note">
            Implementations may or may not separate the implementations of CDMs or treat them as separate from the user agent.
            This is transparent to the API and application.

        </dd>

        <dt id="key-system">Key System</dt>
        <dd>
          <p>A Key System is a generic term for a decryption mechanism and/or content protection provider.
          Key System strings provide unique identification of a Key System.
          They are used by the user agent to select a <a def-id="cdm"></a> and identify the source of a key-related event.
          User agents MUST support the <a href="#common-key-systems">Common Key Systems</a>.
          User agents MAY also provide additional CDMs with corresponding Key System strings.
          </p>

          <p>A Key System string is always a reverse domain name.
          Key System strings are compared using case-sensitive matching. It is RECOMMENDED that CDMs use simple lower-case ASCII key system strings.</p>
          <p class="note">For example, "com.example.somesystem".</p>

          <p class="note">
          Within a given system ("somesystem" in the example), subsystems may be defined as determined by the key system provider.
          For example, "com.example.somesystem.1" and "com.example.somesystem.1_5".
          Key System providers should keep in mind that these will be used for comparison and discovery, so they should be easy to compare and the structure should remain reasonably simple.

        <dt id="key-session">Key Session</dt>
        <dd>
          <p>A Key Session, or simply Session, provides a context for message exchange with the <a def-id="cdm"></a> as a result of which key(s) are made available to the CDM.
          Sessions are embodied as <a>MediaKeySession</a> objects.
          Each Key session is associated with a single instance of <a def-id="initialization-data"></a> provided in the <a def-id="generateRequest"></a> call.
          </p>
          <p>Each Key Session is associated with a single <a>MediaKeys</a> object, and only media element(s) associated with that <a>MediaKeys</a> object may access key(s) associated with the session.
          Other <a>MediaKeys</a> objects, CDM instances, and media elements MUST NOT access the key session or use its key(s).
          Key sessions and the keys they contain are no longer <a def-id="usable-for-decryption"></a> once the session has been closed, including when the <a>MediaKeySession</a> object is destroyed.
          </p>
          <p>
            All license(s) and key(s) associated with a Key Session which have not been explicitly stored MUST be destroyed when the Key Session is closed.
          </p>
          <p><a def-id="key-id">Key IDs</a> MUST be unique within a session.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt id="session-id">Session ID</dt>
        <dd>
          <p>A Session ID is a unique string identifier generated by the <a def-id="cdm"></a> that can be used by the application to identify <a>MediaKeySession</a> objects.</p>

          <p>A new Session ID is generated each time the user agent and CDM successfully create a new session.</p>

          <p>Each Session ID SHALL be unique within the browsing context in which it was created.
            For session types for which the <a def-id="is-persistent-session-type-algorithm"></a> algorithm returns <code>true</code>, Session IDs MUST be unique within the <a def-id="origin"></a> over time, including across browsing sessions.
          </p>

          <p class="note">The underlying content protection protocol does not necessarily need to support Session IDs.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt id="decryption-key">Key</dt>
        <dd>
          <p>Unless otherwise stated, key refers to a decryption key that can be used to decrypt blocks within <a def-id="media-data"></a>.
          Each such key is uniquely identified by a <a def-id="key-id"></a>.
          A key is associated with the <a href="#key-session">session</a> used to provide it to the <a def-id="cdm"></a>. (The same key may be present in multiple sessions.)
          Such keys MUST only be provided to the CDM via an <a def-id="update"></a> call. (They may later be loaded by <a def-id="load"></a> as part of the stored session data.)
          </p>

          <p class="note">Authors SHOULD encrypt each set of stream(s) that requires enforcement of a meaningfully different policy with a distinct key (and key ID).
            For example, if policies may differ between two video resolutions, stream(s) containing one resolution should not be encrypted with the key used to encrypt stream(s) containing the other resolution.
            When encrypted, audio streams SHOULD NOT use the same key as any video stream.
            This is the only way to ensure enforcement and compatibility across clients.

        <dt id="usable-for-decryption">Usable For Decryption</dt>
        <dd>
          <p>A key is considered usable for decryption if the CDM is certain the key is currently usable to decrypt one or more blocks of <a def-id="media-data"></a>.</p>
          <p class="note">For example, a key is not usable for decryption if its license has expired.  Even if its license has not expired, a key is not usable for decryption if other conditions (e.g., output protection) for its use are not currently satisfied.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt id="decryption-key-id">Key ID</dt>
        <dd>
          <p>A <a href="#decryption-key">key</a> is associated with a key ID that is a sequence of octets and which uniquely identifies the key.
          The container specifies the ID of the key that can decrypt a block or set of blocks within the <a def-id="media-data"></a>.
          <a def-id="initialization-data"></a> MAY contain key ID(s) to identify the keys that are needed to decrypt the media data.
          However, there is no requirement that Initialization Data contain any or all key IDs used in the <a def-id="media-data"></a> or <a def-id="media-resource"></a>.
          <a href="#license">Licenses</a> provided to the <a def-id="cdm"></a> associate each key with a key ID so the CDM can select the appropriate key when decrypting an encrypted block of media data.
          </p>
        </dd>

        <dt id="known-key">Known Key</dt>
        <dd>
          <p>A key is considered to be known to a session if the <a def-id="cdm"></a>'s implementation of the session contains any information - specifically the <a def-id="key-id"></a> - about it, regardless of whether the actual <a href="#decryption-key">key</a> is usable or its value is known.
            Known keys are exposed via the <a def-id="keyStatuses"></a> attribute.
          </p>

          <p>Keys are considered known even after they become unusable, such as due to <a def-id="expiration-time">expiration</a> or if they are removed but a <a def-id="record-of-license-destruction"></a> is available.
            Keys only become unknown when they are explicitly removed from a session and any license release message is acknowledged.
          </p>

          <p class="note">For example, a key could become unknown if an <a def-id="update"></a> call provides a new license that does not include the key and includes instructions to replace the license(s) that previously contained the key.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt id="license">License</dt>
        <dd>
          <p>A license is key system-specific state information that includes one or more <a href="#decryption-key">key(s)</a> - each associated with a <a def-id="key-id"></a> - and potentially other information about key usage.</p>
        </dd>

        <dd>
          <p class="note">
          <a def-id="keysystems"></a> usually require a block of initialization data containing information about the stream to be decrypted before they can construct a license request message.
          This block could be a simple key or content ID or a more complex structure containing such information.
          It SHOULD always allow unique identification of the <a href="#decryption-key">key(s)</a> needed to decrypt the content.
          This initialization information MAY be obtained in some application-specific way or provided with the <a def-id="media-data"></a>.
          </p>

          <p>
          Initialization Data is a generic term for container-specific data that is used by a <a def-id="cdm"></a> to generate a license request.
          </p>

          <p>
          The format of the initialization data depends upon the type of container, and containers MAY support more than one format
          of initialization data. The <dfn id="initialization-data-type">Initialization Data Type</dfn> is a string that indicates the
          format of the accompanying Initialization Data. Initialization Data Type strings are always matched case-sensitively. It is
          RECOMMENDED that Initialization Data Type strings are lower-case ASCII strings.
          </p>

          <p>
          The Encrypted Media Extensions Stream Format and Initialization Data Format Registry [[EME-INITDATA-REGISTRY]]
          provides the mapping from <a def-id="initialization-data-type"></a> string to the specification for each format.
          </p>

          <p>
          When the user agent encounters Initialization Data in the <a def-id="media-data"></a>, it provides that Initialization Data to the application in the <a def-id="encrypted-event-initdata-attribute"></a> attribute of the <a def-id="encrypted"></a> event.
          The user agent MUST NOT store the Initialization Data or use its <em>content</em> at the time it is encountered.
          The application provides Initialization Data to the CDM via <a def-id="generateRequest"></a>.
          The user agent MUST NOT provide Initialization Data to the CDM by other means.
          </p>

          <p>Initialization Data MUST be a fixed value for a given set of stream(s) or <a def-id="media-data"></a>.
            It MUST only contain information related to the keys required to play a given set of stream(s) or <a def-id="media-data"></a>.
            It MUST NOT contain application data, client-specific data, user-specific data, or executable code.
          </p>

          <p>Initialization Data SHOULD NOT contain Key System-specific data or values.
            Implementations MUST support the common formats defined in [[EME-INITDATA-REGISTRY]] for each <a def-id="initialization-data-type"></a> they support.
          </p>
          <p class="note">
            Use of proprietary formats/contents is discouraged, and supporting or using <em>only</em> proprietary formats is strongly discouraged.

              A Distinctive Identifier is a value, including in opaque or encrypted form, for which it is possible for any entity external to the client to correlate or associate values beyond what a user may expect on the web platform (e.g., cookies and other site data).

              b) <a def-id="browsing-profile">browsing profiles</a>,

              or values for which it is not easy for a user to break such association.

            <h5>Get Supported Configuration</h5>
            <p>Given a <a def-id="keysystems"></a> implementation <var>implementation</var>, <a>MediaKeySystemConfiguration</a> <var>candidate configuration</var>, and <var>origin</var>, this algorithm returns a supported configuration or <code>NotSupported</code> as appropriate.</p>
            <p class="note">Unrecognized dictionary members in <var>candidate configuration</var> are ignored per [[WEBIDL]] and will never reach this algorithm. Thus, they cannot be considered as part of the configuration.
            </p>
            <div class="note">
              <p>
              For certain configurations, it may be required to obtain user consent or inform the user. User Agents have some flexibility to determine
              whether consent is required for a specific configuration and whether such consent may also apply to other configurations. For example,
              consent to one configuration may also imply consent for less powerful, more restricted configurations. Equally, a denial of consent for
              one configuration may imply denial of consent for more powerful, less restricted configurations.
              </p>
              <p>
              Supported configurations, including supported audio and video codecs, may depend on availability of optional capabilities such as
              <a def-id="distinctive-identifier-maybe-plural"></a> and persistent state. The following algorithm iteratively tries to find a configuration
              that is both supported and has user consent (or does not need consent).
              </p>
              <p>
              User Agents should reuse earlier consent responses, when appropriate, at least for the duration of the <a def-id="requestMediaKeySystemAccess"></a>
              algorithm in order to avoid repeated requests to the user for similar configurations.
              </p>
              <p>
                The variable <var>restrictions</var> in the steps below represents the configurations for which consent has been denied during the
                execution of this algorithm or based on persisted consent information for the origin. It is used to determine
                whether user consent for a candidate configuration or accumulated configuration has been denied. Consent is denied for a accumulated configuration
                if every derived configuration has already been denied. Internal representation of <var>restrictions</var> is implementation-specific.
              </p>

        <h3>Storage and Persistence</h3>

        <p>
          If a <a>MediaKeys</a> object's <var>persistent state allowed</var> value is <code>false</code> then the object's <var>cdm instance</var>
          SHALL NOT persist state or access previously persisted state as a result of operations on this object or any sessions that it creates.

        <p>
          If a <a>MediaKeys</a> object's <var>persistent state allowed</var> value is <code>true</code> then the object's <var>cdm instance</var>
          MAY persist state or access previously persisted state as a result of operations on this object or any sessions that it creates.
        </p>

        <p>Persisted data MUST always be stored such that only the <a def-id="origin"></a> of this object's <a def-id="document-concept"></a> can access it.
          In addition, the data MUST only be accessible by the current <a def-id="browsing-profile"></a>; other browsing profiles, user agents, and applications MUST NOT be able to access the stored data.

      <h2><dfn>MediaKeySession</dfn> Interface</h2>
      <p>The MediaKeySession object represents a <a href="#key-session">key session</a>.</p>
      <p>
        A <a>MediaKeySession</a> object is <dfn id="media-key-session-closed">closed</dfn> if and only if the object's <a def-id="closed"></a> attribute has been resolved.
      </p>
      <p>
        The User Agent SHALL execute the <a def-id="monitor-cdm-algorithm"></a> algorithm continuously for each <a>MediaKeySession</a> object
        that is not <a def-id="media-key-session-closed"></a>.
        The <a def-id="monitor-cdm-algorithm"></a> algorithm MUST be run in parallel to the main event loop but not in parallel to other procedures defined
        in this specification that are also defined to be run in parallel.
      </p>
      <p>
        A <a>MediaKeySession</a> object SHALL NOT be destroyed and SHALL continue to receive events if it is
        not <a def-id="media-key-session-closed"></a> and the <a>MediaKeys</a> object that created it remains accessible.
        Otherwise, a <a>MediaKeySession</a> object that is no longer accessible SHALL NOT receive further
        events and MAY be destroyed.
      </p>
      <p class="note">
        The above rule implies that the CDM instance must not be destroyed until all <a>MediaKeys</a>
        objects and all <a>MediaKeySession</a> objects associated with the CDM instance are destroyed.
      </p>
      <p>
        If a <a>MediaKeySession</a> object is not <a def-id="media-key-session-closed"></a> when it becomes inaccessible to the page, the CDM SHALL close the <a href="#key-session">key session</a> associated with the object.
      </p>
      <p class="note">Closing the key session results in the destruction of any license(s) and key(s) that have not been explicitly stored.</p>
      <p class="note">
        Exactly when the key session is closed is an implementation detail, and applications SHOULD NOT rely on specific timing.
        <!-- TODO: Replace and/or expand on this with an implementation of Issue #360. -->
        Applications that want to ensure a session is closed before taking some other action SHOULD call <a def-id="close"></a> and wait for the returned promise to be resolved.
      </p>
      <p>For methods that return a promise, all errors are reported asynchronously by rejecting the returned Promise. This includes [[WEBIDL]] type mapping errors.</p>
      <p>The following steps of an algorithm are always aborted when rejecting a promise.</p>

            The session was closed because the CDM's original hardware context was reset.
            When this occurs, the User Agent MUST allow the application to create new sessions on this <a>MediaKeys</a> instance.
            <div class="note">
              <p>
                This could occur for many reasons, including device hibernation, monitor configuration change, etc.
                The exact reasons for a hardware context reset are implementation-dependent.

            The session was closed because the system needed to reclaim resources to allow the creation of other sessions.
            <div class="note">
              <p>
                This would imply that the application is running into a device-specific limit on session resources.
                If the closed session is still needed for some reason, the application developer should consider some strategy to reduce the number of sessions needed or proactively close unneeded sessions.

        <h3>Session Storage and Persistence</h3>
        <p>This section provides an overview of session storage and persistence that complements the algorithms.</p>
        <p>The following requirements apply in addition to those in <a def-id="media-keys-storage"></a>.</p>
        <p>If the result of running the <a def-id="is-persistent-session-type-algorithm"></a> algorithm on this object's <var>session type</var> is <code>false</code>, the user agent and CDM MUST NOT persist a record of or data related to the session at any point.
          This includes license(s), key(s), <a def-id="record-of-license-destruction-maybe-plural"></a>, and the <a def-id="session-id"></a>.
        </p>
        <p>The remainder of this section applies to session types for which the <a def-id="is-persistent-session-type-algorithm"></a> algorithm returns <code>true</code>.</p>
        <p>The CDM SHOULD NOT store session data, including the Session ID, until <a def-id="update"></a> is called the first time.
          Specifically, the CDM SHOULD NOT store session data during the <a def-id="generateRequest"></a> algorithm.
          This ensures that the application is aware of the session and knows it needs to eventually remove it.
        </p>
        <p><em>All</em> data associated with a session MUST be cleared when the session is cleared, such as in <a def-id="update"></a> when processing a <a def-id="record-of-license-destruction"></a> acknowledgement.
          See <a href="#persistent-state-requirements">Persistent Data</a>.
        </p>
        <p>The CDM MUST ensure that data for a given session is only present in one <a>MediaKeySession</a> object that is not
        <a def-id="media-key-session-closed"></a> in any <a def-id="document-concept"></a>.
          In other words, <a def-id="load"></a> MUST fail when there is already a <a>MediaKeySession</a> representing the session specified by the <var>sessionId</var> parameter, either because the object that created it via <a def-id="generateRequest"></a> is still active or it has been loaded into another object via <a def-id="load"></a>.
          A session MAY only be loaded again if all objects that have ever represented it are <a def-id="media-key-session-closed"></a>.
        </p>
        <p>An application that creates a session using a type for which the <a def-id="is-persistent-session-type-algorithm"></a> algorithm returns <code>true</code> SHOULD
          later remove the stored data by first initiating the removal process using <a def-id="remove"></a> and then ensuring that the removal process, which may involve
          message exchange(s), successfully completes. The CDM MAY also remove sessions as appropriate, but applications SHOULD NOT rely on this.
        </p>
        <p>See <a href="#security"></a> and <a href="#privacy"></a> for additional considerations when supporting persistent storage.</p>

      <h2><dfn>HTMLMediaElement</dfn> Extensions</h2>

      <!-- Put all the monkey-patching here -->

      <p>This section specifies additions to and modifications of the <a def-id="htmlmediaelement"></a> [[HTML]] when the Encrypted Media Extensions are supported.</p>
      <p>The following internal values are added to the <a def-id="htmlmediaelement"></a>:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p><var>attaching media keys</var>, which SHALL have a boolean value, and</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><var>encrypted block queue</var>, which SHALL be a queue of encrypted blocks awaiting decryption, and</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><var>decryption blocked waiting for key</var>, which SHALL have a boolean value.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><var>playback blocked waiting for key</var>, which SHALL have a boolean value.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>The following modifications are made to the behaviour of the <a def-id="htmlmediaelement"></a>:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>When a <a def-id="htmlmediaelement"></a> is created, its <var>attaching media keys</var> value SHALL be initialized to <code>false</code>, its <var>encrypted block queue</var> value SHALL be empty, its <var>decryption blocked waiting for key</var> value SHALL be initialized to <code>false</code>, and its <var>playback blocked waiting for key</var> value SHALL be initialized to <code>false</code>.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>When the <a def-id="current-playback-position"></a> is changed other than advancing in the <a def-id="direction-of-playback"></a> as part of normal playback, the <var>encrypted block queue</var> value SHALL be empty, the <var>decryption blocked waiting for key</var> value SHALL be initialized to <code>false</code>, and the <var>playback blocked waiting for key</var> value SHALL be set to <code>false</code>.</p>
          <p class="note">
            In other words, these values should be reset when, for example, <a def-id="loading-the-media-resource"></a> or <a def-id="seeking"></a>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>In addition to the criteria specified in [[HTML]], an <a def-id="htmlmediaelement"></a> SHALL be considered a <a def-id="blocked-media-element"></a> if its <var>playback blocked waiting for key</var> value is <code>true</code>.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>When the user agent is ready to begin playback and has encountered an indication that the <a def-id="media-data"></a> may contain encrypted blocks during the <a def-id="resource-fetch-algorithm"></a>, the user agent SHALL run the <a href="#media-may-contain-encrypted-blocks">Media Data May Contain Encrypted Blocks</a> algorithm.</p>
          <p class="note">
            For some container formats, such indication is separate from <a def-id="initialization-data"></a>.
          </p>
          <p class="note">
            The algorithm is to be run after parsing the relevant container data, including running the <a def-id="initdata-encountered-algorithm"></a> algorithm, but before decoding starts.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>When the user agent encounters <a def-id="initialization-data"></a> in the <a def-id="media-data"></a> during the <a def-id="resource-fetch-algorithm"></a>, the user agent SHALL run the <a def-id="initdata-encountered-algorithm"></a> algorithm.</p>
          <p class="note">
            Some container formats may support encrypted media data that does not contain <a def-id="initialization-data"></a> and thus support media data that does not trigger this algorithm.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>For each block of encrypted <a def-id="media-data"></a> encountered during the <a def-id="resource-fetch-algorithm"></a>, the user agent SHALL run the <a def-id="encrypted-block-encountered-algorithm"></a> algorithm in the order the encrypted blocks were encountered.</p>
          <p class="note">The above step provides flexibility for user agent implementations to perform decryption at any time after an encrypted block is encountered before it is needed for playback.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>When one of the following occurs while the <var>decryption blocked waiting for key</var> value is <code>true</code>, the user agent SHALL run the <a def-id="wait-for-key-algorithm"></a> algorithm.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><p>The user agent cannot advance the <a def-id="current-playback-position"></a> in the <a def-id="direction-of-playback"></a>.</p></li>
            <li>
              <p>The user agent cannot provide data for the <a def-id="current-playback-position"></a>.</p>
              <p class="note">For example, at the beginning of playback or after <a def-id="seeking"></a>.</p>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Additional attributes and a method are added, as specified below.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>For methods that return a promise, all errors are reported asynchronously by rejecting the returned Promise. This includes [[WEBIDL]] type mapping errors.</p>
      <p>The steps of an algorithm are always aborted when rejecting a promise.</p>

        <h3>Media Element Restrictions</h3>
        <p>Media data processed by a CDM MAY be unavailable through web platform APIs in the usual way (for example using the CanvasRenderingContext2D drawImage() method and the AudioContext MediaElementAudioSourceNode).
        This specification does not define conditions for such non-availability of media data, however, if media data is not available to through such APIs then they MAY behave as if no media data was present at all.</p>
        <p>Where media rendering is not performed by the UA, for example in the case of a hardware-based media pipeline, the full set of HTML rendering capabilities, for example CSS Transforms, MAY be unavailable. One likely restriction is that
        video media MAY be constrained to appear only in rectangular regions with sides parallel to the edges of the window and with normal orientation.</p>

    <section id="implementation-requirements">
      <h3>Implementation Requirements</h3>
      <p>
        This section defines implementation requirements - for both user agents and <a def-id="keysystems"></a>, including the <a def-id="cdm"></a> and server(s) - that may not be explicitly addressed in the algorithms.
        The requirements here and throughout the spec apply to all implementations, regardless of whether the CDM is separate from or a part of the user agent.
      </p>

      <section id="cdm-constraint-requirements">
        <h3>CDM Constraints</h3>
        <p>
          User agent implementers MUST ensure that CDMs do not access any information, storage or system capabilities that are not reasonably required for playback of protected media using the features of this specification.
          Specifically, the CDM SHALL NOT:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              Access network resources, either local or remote, except via the user agent as explicitly permitted by this specification.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Access storage (e.g., disk or memory), except where reasonably required for playback of protected media using the features of this specification.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Access user data other than CDM state and <a href="#persistent-state-requirements">persistent data</a>.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Access hardware components or devices, except where reasonably required for playback of protected media using the features of this specification.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          User Agent implementers may use various techniques to meet the above requirements. For example, a User Agent implementer also implementing their own CDM may include the above as design requirements for that component.
          A User Agent implementer making use of a third party CDM may ensure that it executes in a constrained environment (e.g., "sandbox") without access to the prohibited information and components.

          All messages and communication to and from the CDM, such as between the CDM and a license server, MUST be passed through the user agent.
          The CDM MUST NOT make direct out-of band network requests.
          All messages and communication other than those described in <a href="#direct-individualization">Direct Individualization</a> MUST be passed through the application via the APIs defined in this specification.
          Specifically, all communication that contains application-, <a def-id="origin"></a>-, or content-specific information or is sent to a URL specified by the application or based on its origin, MUST pass through the APIs.

        <h4>Individualization</h4>
        <p>
          Identifiers, especially <a def-id="distinctive-identifiers"></a>, are sometimes generated or obtained via a process called individualization or provisioning.
          The resulting identifier(s) MUST be <a def-id="non-associable-by-application"></a> and <a href="#uses-distinctive-identifiers">use of them</a> MUST only be exposed to a <a href="#per-origin-per-profile-identifiers">single origin from a single profile</a>.

        <p>This process MUST be performed either <a href="#direct-individualization">directly by the user agent</a> or <a href="#app-assisted-individualization">through the application</a>.
          The mechanisms, flow, and restrictions for the two types of individualization are different, as described in the following sections.
          Which method is used depends on the CDM implementation and application of the requirements of this specification, especially those below.
        </p>
        <p class="note">

          <p>
            Direct Individualization is performed between the <a def-id="cdm"></a> and an origin- and application-independent server.
            Although the server is origin-independent, the result of the individualization enables the CDM to provide origin-specific identifiers per the other
            requirements of this specification.
            The process MUST be performed by the user agent and MUST NOT use the APIs defined in this specification.
          </p>
          <p class="note">For example, such a process may initialize a client device and/or obtain a <a href="#per-origin-per-profile-identifiers">per-origin</a> <a href="#allow-identifiers-cleared">clearable</a> identifier for <a href="#per-origin-per-profile-identifiers">a single browsing profile</a> by communicating with a pre-determined server hosted by the user agent or CDM vendor, possibly <a href="#uses-distinctive-permanent-identifiers">using Distinctive Permanent Identifier(s)</a> or other <a href="#permanent-identifier">Permanent Identifier(s)</a> from the client device.
          </p>
          <p>For such individualization, all message exchanges:</p>

            To preserve the benefits of such a design and to avoid introducing other privacy concerns,
            such implementations and the applications that support them SHOULD avoid deferring or forwarding individualization messages to a central server or other server not controlled by the application author.

            The media container MUST NOT be encrypted.

            Decryption of such tracks - especially such that they can be provided back the user agent - is not generally supported by implementations.

        <h3>CDM Attacks and Vulnerabilities</h3>
        <p>User Agents are responsible for providing users with a secure way to browse the web.
          This responsibility applies to any functionality used by User Agents, including functionalities from third parties.
          User agent implementers MUST obtain sufficient information from Key System implementers to enable them to properly assess the security implications of integrating with the Key System.
          User agent implementers MUST ensure CDM implementations provide and/or support sufficient controls for the user agent to provide security for the user.
          User agent implementers MUST ensure CDM implementations can and will be quickly and proactively updated in the event of security vulnerabilities.
        </p>
        <p>Exploiting a CDM implementation that is not fully sandboxed and/or uses platform features may allow an attacker to access OS or platform features, elevate privilege (e.g., to run as system or root), and/or access drivers, kernel, firmware, hardware, etc.
          Such features, software, and hardware may not be written to be robust against hostile software or web-based attacks and may not be updated with security fixes, especially compared to the user agent.
          Lack of, infrequent, or slow updates for fixes to security vulnerabilities in CDM implementations increases the risk.
          Such CDM implementations and UAs that expose them MUST be especially careful in all areas of security, including parsing of <a href="#input-data-security">all data</a>.
        </p>
        <p class="note">User agents should be especially diligent when using a CDM or underlying mechanism that is part of or provided by the client OS, platform and/or hardware.</p>

        <h3>User Tracking</h3>
        <section class="informative">
          <h4>Concerns</h4>
          <p>A third-party host (or any entity, such as an advertiser, capable of getting content distributed to multiple sites) could use a <a def-id="distinctive-identifier"></a> or persistent data, including licenses, keys, key IDs, or 
            <a def-id="records-of-license-destruction"></a>, stored by or on behalf of the <a def-id="cdm"></a> to track a user across multiple sessions (including across <a def-id="origin">origins</a> and <a def-id="browsing-profile">browsing profiles</a>), building a profile of the user's activities or interests.  Such tracking would undermine the privacy protections provided by the rest of the web platform and could, for example, enable highly-targeted advertising not otherwise possible.
            In conjunction with a site that is aware of the user's real identity (for example, a content provider or e-commerce site that requires authenticated credentials), this could allow oppressive groups to target individuals with greater accuracy than in a world with purely anonymous web usage.
          </p>

          <p>User- or client-specific information that could be obtained via implementations of the APIs in this specification includes:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><p><a def-id="distinctive-identifier-maybe-plural"></a></p></li>
            <li><p><a def-id="distinctive-permanent-identifier-maybe-plural"></a></p></li>
            <li><p>Origins visited (via stored or in-memory data, permissions, etc.)</p></li>
            <li><p>Content viewed (via stored or in-memory licenses, keys, key IDs, <a def-id="records-of-license-destruction"></a>, etc.)</p></li>
          </ul>
          <p>This specification presents a specific concern because such information is commonly stored outside the user agent (and associated <a def-id="browsing-profile"></a> storage), often in the CDM.</p>

          <p>Since the content of licenses and <a def-id="records-of-license-destruction"></a> are Key System-specific and since key IDs may contain any value, these data items could be abused to store user-identifying information.</p>

          <p>Key Systems may access or create persistent or semi-persistent identifier(s) for a device or user of a device.
            In some cases these identifiers may be bound to a specific device in a secure manner.
            If these identifiers are present in Key System messages, then devices and/or users may be tracked.
            If the mitigations below are not applied, this could include both tracking of users / devices over time and associating multiple users of a given device.
          </p>

          <p>It is important to note that such identifiers, especially those that are non-clearable, non-<a def-id="origin"></a>-specific, or <a href="#permanent-identifier">permanent</a>, exceed the tracking impact of existing techniques such as cookies [[COOKIES]] or session identifiers embedded in URLs.</p>

          <p>If not mitigated, such tracking may take three forms depending on the design of the Key System:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><p>In all cases, such identifiers are expected to be available to sites and/or servers that fully support the Key System (and thus can interpret Key System messages) enabling tracking by such sites.</p></li>
            <li><p>If identifiers exposed by Key Systems are not origin-specific, then two sites and/or servers that fully support the Key System may collude to track the user.</p></li>
            <li><p>If Key System messages contain information derived from a user identifier in a consistent manner, for example such that a portion of the initial Key System message for a specific content item does not change over time and is dependent on the user identifier, then this information could be used by any application to track the device or user over time.</p></li>
          </ul>

          <p>In addition, if a Key System permits keys or other data to be stored and to be re-used between origins, then it may be possible for two origins to collude and track a unique user by recording their ability to access a common key.</p>
          <p>Finally, if any user interface for user control of Key Systems presents data separately from data in HTTP session cookies [[COOKIES]] or persistent storage, then users are likely to modify site authorization or delete data in one and not the others.
            This would allow sites to use the various features as redundant backup for each other, defeating a user's attempts to protect his or her privacy.
          </p>

          <p>
            In addition to the potential for sites and other third-parties to track users, the user agent implementer, CDM vendor, or device vendor could build a profile of the user's activities or interests, such as sites using the APIs defined in this specification that the user visits.
            Such tracking would undermine the privacy protections provided by the rest of the web platform, especially those related to isolation of origins.
          </p>

          <p>
            Identifiers, such as <a def-id="distinctive-identifiers"></a>, may be obtained from a server operated or provided by the CDM vendor, such as via an <a href="#individualization">individualization</a> process.
            The process may include providing client identifier(s), including <a def-id="distinctive-permanent-identifier-maybe-plural"></a>, to the server.
            In order to generate a per-origin identifier, a value representing the origin may also be provided.
          </p>

          <p>
            In such an implementation, the CDM vendor may be able to track the activity of the user, such as number of origins visited or number of times a new identifier is required.
            If the origin or a value <a def-id="associable"></a> with the origin is provided in the identifier request, the CDM vendor could track the sites visited by the user or user(s) of a device.
          </p>
          <p>The following section describes techniques that may mitigate the risks of tracking without user consent.</p>
