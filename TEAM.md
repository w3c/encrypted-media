# Editor Team Instructions

This document contains information used by the editors maintaining the specification.

## Updating `index.html`

>Note: The following references the main spec, but similar steps apply for registry files.

`index.html` is the published version of the specification.
Unlike some other ReSpec-based specifications, this one does not rely on runtime generation when viewing the specification.
Thus, a new `index.html` must be generated, committed, and pushed in order for changes to the `-respec.html` file to be reflected.
We generally do this for every commit, but sometimes we only generate the file once for a series of commits.

Use the following steps to publish the new index.html after modifying the `-respec.html` file:

1. Open an Incognito or private browsing window. (This generally ensures that extensions are not loaded and will not interfere with the output.)
1. Open the `-respec.html` file in that window.
1. **Verify that there are no errors** next to the ReSpec bubble in the upper right corner.
1. **Verify that ReSpec completed and there are no exceptions** by checking the browser's console (i.e. `Ctrl+Shift+i`). You should see no messages.
1. ReSpec button => Save Snapshot => Save as HTML
1. `mv ~/Downloads/index.html ./`
1. Review the diff in a tool like `gitk`.
  * `-respec.html` should contain just your edits.
  * `index.html` should generally contain diffes related to your edits. However, sometimes, such as when a Note is added or ReSpec has been updated, there will be lots of unrelated changes.
1. `git commit -a`
1. `git push`

## Handling Pull Requests

This spec now uses the green "Merge pull request" button on GitHub. Using the steps below, this automatically ensures that each change is a single commit on the main `gh-pages` branch.  

Manual merge instructions are retained below for reference, but are not recommended.

### Merging Pull Requests With the Green "Merge Pull Request" Button ##

1. The Green "Merge pull request" button on the Pull Request page will be enabled only if all checks have passed and there are no conflicts between the Pull Request and the base branch.
1. When ready to merge:
  1. Click the green "Merge pull request" button.
  1. Choose to squash and merge from the button drop down menu.
  1. Click the green "Confirm squash and merge" button.
  1. Clean up the commit summary - single line field of bold text.
     * Use the format "Issue #123: Description" or "Fix #123: Description" as the merge title.
     * Use "Fix" if this merge resolves all items in the issue and the issue should be closed.
  1. Clean up the additional commit text in the multiline text box below the summary.
     * Most often, you will want to delete all of the text.
     * The most likely exception is when there was some useful additional information in one of the commit messages in the PR. You may also want to provide some additional information in addition to the summary.

## Manual Pull Request Steps (for reference only) ##
Manual steps for merging Pull Requests are retained below.  They are not the preferred method for merging, and are retained for reference only.

The following subsections contain manual instructions for merging. They assume the Bash functions that follow them are present.

### Merging Pull Requests from Forks

1. `git checkout gh-pages`
1. `pr <pull request ID>`
1. If the pull request contains multiple commits, squash them as appropriate.
   * In general, all commits and merges should be squashed into a single commit.
   * If commits or sets of commits represent multiple distinct actions (i.e. do something then rename a variable), then the branch might be squashed into two or more commits, each representing a distinct action.
   * Squash commits by running `git rebase -i origin/gh-pages` then using `squash` on the commit(s) to be squashed.
1. If index.html is not part of the pull request and needs to be updated:
  1. Generate index.html.
  1. Run the following:
     * `git add index.html`
     * `git commit --amend`
1. If the commit message needs to be updated (i.e. To add "Fix #\<bug ID\>: "), do one of the following and update the message:
    * Run `git rebase -i origin/gh-pages` then use `reword` to select the commit(s) to reword.
    * Run `git commit --amend` and edit the last commit message.
1. `git push`
1. Close the pull request by following these steps in the web interface:
  1. Let `hash` be the the commit hash.
  1. Navigate to the pull request.
  1. Add a comment that say "Merged as `hash`." and click the "Close pull request" button to post that
comment.

### Merging Pull Requests from Branches
For pull requests coming from branches within this repository, use the same steps above except use `mypr` and there is no reason to use the web interface.

`git push` will _automatically_ close the pull request and mark it as merged, since the commits contained there were updated.

### Bash Functions
The following is based on https://github.com/whatwg/html/blob/master/TEAM.md.

```
pr () {
  git fetch origin refs/pull/$1/head:refs/remotes/origin/pr/$1 --force
  git checkout -b pr/$1 origin/pr/$1
  git rebase gh-pages
  git checkout gh-pages
  git merge pr/$1 --ff-only
}
```
Pulls down the PR into a local branch, using [the special refs GitHub provides](https://help.github.com/articles/checking-out-pull-requests-locally/); rebases the PR's commits on top of `gh-pages`; and does a fast-forward only merge into `gh-pages`.

```
mypr () {
  git checkout $1
  git rebase gh-pages
  git push origin $1 --force
  git checkout gh-pages
  git merge $1 --ff-only
}
```
Rebases the PR on top of `gh-pages`; force-pushes it to the appropriate branch, thus updating the PR; and does the fast-forward only merge into `gh-pages`.
