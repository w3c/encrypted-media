        This specification defines the stream format for using ISO Base Media
        File Format [[!ISOBMFF]] content that uses the ISO Common Encryption
        protection schemes [[!CENC]] with the <a def-id="eme-spec"></a>
        [[!ENCRYPTED-MEDIA]].
      </p>
      <p class="note">
        Although the ISO Base Media File Format [[!ISOBMFF]] associated with
        this format's MIME type/subtype strings supports multiple protection
        schemes, when used with Encrypted Media Extensions, these strings refer
        specifically to content encrypted and packaged using the 'cenc' or
        'cbcs' protection schemes, as defined by section 4.2 of [[!CENC]].

      <h2>Stream Format</h2>
      <p>
        ISO Base Media File Format [[!ISOBMFF]] content that is encrypted using
        the ISO Common Encryption protection schemes [[!CENC]] SHALL be
        encrypted at the sample level with either the 'cenc' (AES-128 CTR) or
        'cbcs' (AES-128 CBC) encryption schemes, as defined in section 4.2 of
        [[!CENC]].  These protection methods enabls multiple Key Systems to
        decrypt the same media content.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each key is identified by a <a def-id="key-id"></a> and each encrypted
        sample is associated with the key ID of the key needed to decrypt it.
        This association is signaled either through the specification of a
        default key ID in the track encryption box ('tenc') or by assigning the
        sample to a Sample Group, the definition of which specifies a key ID.
        Streams may contain a mixture of encrypted and unencrypted samples.
      </p>

    <section id="detect-format">
      <h2>Detection</h2>
      <p>
        For a stream determined to be in the ISO Base Media File Format
        [[!ISOBMFF]], the ISO Common Encryption protection schemes may be
        detected as follows.
      </p>
      <p>
        Protection scheme signaling conforms with [[!ISOBMFF]]. When protection
        has been applied, the stream type will be transformed to 'encv' for
        video or 'enca' for audio, with a Protection Scheme Information Box
        ('sinf') added to the sample entry in the Sample Description Box
        ('stsd'). The Protection Scheme Information Box ('sinf') will contain a
        Scheme Type Box ('schm') with a scheme_type field set to a value of
        <code>'cenc'</code> or <code>'cbcs'</code>. [[!CENC]]

    <section id="detect-encrypted-blocks">
      <h2>Detecting Encrypted Blocks</h2>
      <p>
        For the purposes of the <a
        def-id="encrypted-block-encountered-algorithm"></a>, encrypted blocks
        are identified as follows.
      </p>
      <p>
        The encrypted block is a sample. Determining whether a sample is
        encrypted depends on the corresponding Track Encryption Box ('tenc') and
        the sample group with grouping type 'seig' (CencSampleEncryption group),
        if any, associated with the sample.  The default encryption state of a
        sample is defined by the IsEncrypted flag in the associated track
        encryption box ('tenc'). This default state may be modified by the
        IsEncrypted flag in the SampleGroupDescriptionBox ('sgpd'), pointed to
        by an index in the SampleToGroupBox ('sbgp').
      </p>
      <p>
        Samples can be partially encrypted, specified by subsample information
        referenced by SampleAuxiliaryInformationSizesBox ('saiz') and
        SampleAuxiliaryInformationOffsetsBox ('saio') boxes.

    <section id="init-data">
      <h2>Initialization Data Extraction</h2>
      <p>
        Streams may contain one or more Protection System Specific Header
        ('pssh') boxes [[!CENC]], each for a unique SystemID, at each location
        where a 'pssh' box is necessary.  Content using this stream format
        SHOULD include a box containing the <a def-id="cenc-common-system"></a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a def-id="initialization-data"></a> is always one or more concatenated
        'pssh' boxes as defined by the <a def-id="initdata-registry-cenc"></a>
        [[!EME-INITDATA-REGISTRY]].
      </p>
      <p>
        Each time one or more 'pssh' boxes are encountered, the <a
        def-id="initdata-encountered-algorithm"></a> algorithm SHALL be invoked
        with <var title="">initDataType</var> = <code>"<a
        def-id="initdata-registry-cenc">cenc</a>"</code>
        [[!EME-INITDATA-REGISTRY]] and <var title="">initData</var> = the 'pssh'
        box(es).  Multiple 'pssh' boxes MUST be provided together if and only if
        they appear directly next to each other in the stream.
